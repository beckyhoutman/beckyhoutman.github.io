		<p>I never thought that an article in the national press purporting to feature the pioneering spirits of New Orleanians returning to the most ravaged neighborhoods against all odds, exhibiting the enormous resolve of &#8220;ordinary&#8221; citizens to restore their homes and their dignity whether deserved assistance comes or no, could raise my hackles. But leave it to <a href="http://thinknola.com/post/is-adam-nossiter-a-tool/">Adam Nossiter</a> to prove me wrong. I don&#8217;t have it in me right now to go over the article in detail and how, in the guise of shedding a faint ray of light on the triumphs and struggles of New Orleans citizens, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/us/nationalspecial/02orleans.html?hp">Largely Alone, Pioneers Reclaim New Orleans</a> presents the opportunity to highlight the worst of what&#8217;s happening here and confirm a stereotypical hopelessness arising from the citizenry&#8217;s boundless ineptitude. Which isn&#8217;t to say that the crime rate, the state of public schools, and the planning leadership aren&#8217;t abysmal or bordering on it, but the article conveniently neglects to illustrate the of citizen-led efforts to decry and confront those problems the same way citizens confront the restoration of their physical homes. I&#8217;ll leave one particularly pungent quote to make my case: &#8220;only about one in five [Road Home] applicants &#8211; <em>most of them entitled to it</em> &#8211; have actually received money&#8221; (emphasis mine). <em>Most of them entitled to it.</em> What a pithy summation of the worst sort of condescension. Thanks, Mr. Nossiter, for your gracious observation that New Orleans isn&#8217;t <em>mostly</em> frauds and thieves.</p>        <a href="http://beckyhoutman.com/2007/07/01/never-say-never/"> Comments (0)</a>         </div>

<p><em>Who really holds the keys?</em></p>
<p>I had to wonder whether it was with deliberate irony that yesterday&#8217;s Times Picayune placed the article <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-8/1182836655320170.xml&#38;coll=1">N.O.&#8217;s plan for rebuilding passes Muster with LRA</a> immediately beneath <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-8/1182837573320170.xml&#38;coll=1">LRA feeds Road Home kitty</a>, with it&#8217;s handy inset showing of the approximately $1 billion the state is adding to the Road Home program, $577.5 million is coming from CDBG funds previously slated for infrastructure repairs, and another $50 million was &#8220;carved out of other recovery spending areas&#8221; by the LRA. (The amount to be doled out for New Orleans rebuilding is $117 million &#8211; of the $1.1 billion that &#8220;officials&#8221; (whoever they are these days) say we need.) Oh, and that doesn&#8217;t count the $513 million the LRA now has access to since the 10% match of federal funds requirement was waived &#8211; $513 million the LRA had earmarked for parish recovery projects, of which New Orleans was to receive $324 million &#8211; so they can sit on it in case the state needs to ante up even more cash to help close the Road Home gap.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s TP editorial, <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/editorials/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1182924321177870.xml&#38;coll=1">A good faith effort</a>, claims that &#8220;repairs to storm-damaged state buildings and construction of a replacement for Charity Hospital in New Orleans,&#8221; which were to be paid out of the $577.5 million would be paid out of the state&#8217;s budget, but forgive me if I&#8217;m skeptical.</p>
<p>What really infuriates me is the nearly blind eye being turned to the source of a sizable chunk of the Road Home gap: insurance underpayment, to the estimate tune of $2.7 billion. To be fair, in May <a href="http://insurancetransparencyproject.com/2007/05/28/la-urged-to-make-insurers-pay-up-itp-is-quoted/">Blanco and Walter Leger recommended</a> that the state pursue claims on the behalf of cheated policyholders &#8211; after all, what hope can individuals have suing the colossi piecemeal (the insurance industry is the only other field besides Major League Baseball exempt from antitrust regulation, making the combined insurers a pretty daunting monolith). But it looks like, yet again, insurers have passed the buck to taxpayers, and worse, the state and federal governments have chosen to bleed the programs that are underfunded already. Big surprise.</p>
<p>This is yet another instance of why the entire state and nation should be taking heed of Louisiana&#8217;s and Mississippi&#8217;s situation. Insurers &#8211; property, health, auto, etc. &#8211; are as consequence free everywhere as they are here. The number of ways in which the system is scandalously broken is too great for me to digest, but PLEASE check out the <a href="http://insurancetransparencyproject.com/">Insurance Transparency Project</a> for much more &#8211; inspired by, but not exclusive to, Katrina&#8217;s insurance aftermath.</p>

			<h3>June 23rd, 2007</h3>

			<p><strong><em>For immediate release:</em></strong></p>
<p>The Scrooge-Marley Foundation is pleased to announce a $2.2 million grant to advance a joint initiative by Scrooge-Marley and the New Orleans Office of Repast Management to buy New Orleans lunch. The grant will fund a series of conferences on Menu Development, Seating Arrangement, and Service Strategies, among other lunch-related concerns. &#8220;Mid-day hunger management in the Crescent City and elsewhere has always been a burning concern of ours &#8211; now more than ever,&#8221; said Scrooge-Marley Spokesperson, Waylon Smithers. &#8220;Almost two years later, the region is still reeling from the thousands of lunches lost both in spoiled refrigerators themselves, and in attempts to clean or inspect those spoiled refrigerators. The need is great and the task complex. Recruiting top-notch talent will guarantee that the lunch-preparation efforts are undertaken with the highest degree of professionalism and urgency.&#8221;</p>
<p>NOORP Director B.B. Bumstead added, &#8220;The Scrooge-Marley grant will be critically important in helping the city build the necessary caloric capital to assist in New Orleans&#8217; recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NO Free Lunch program will be administered by the Graham School of Orthopathy&#8217;s Center for Dinner Excellence. &#8220;Katrina was devastating to South Louisiana lunching, but it is incumbant upon all of this to take this as an opportunity to address the endemic dietary poverty of the region, where decades of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kCUKAAAAIAAJ&#38;dq=a+lecture+to+young+men+on+chastity&#38;printsec=frontcover&#38;source=web&#38;ots=f1T5qReKcK&#38;sig=p2gkhnCuDH27CzpeGt7XwPNnvQw#PPA47,M1">high seasoned food, rich dishes, and the free use of flesh</a>, not to mention coffee and wine, have trapped the populace in the cycle of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kCUKAAAAIAAJ&#38;dq=a+lecture+to+young+men+on+chastity&#38;printsec=frontcover&#38;source=web&#38;ots=f1T5qReKcK&#38;sig=p2gkhnCuDH27CzpeGt7XwPNnvQw#PPA60,M1">luxury, indolence, voluptuousness, and sensuality</a> that so gripped the nation&#8217;s and the world&#8217;s hearts in the days following August 29, 2005. What we have here, basically, is a blank plate,&#8221; said Graham President Palmer Onan, &#8220;We are especially pleased to be spearheading the first large-scale mixed-income lunch menu, and are in talks with Hormel regarding the production a fois-gras-and-mixed-baby-greens Spam for the occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Mixed-Income Menu Planning, Seating Arrangement Studies, and Strategizing Food Service, the series of conferences is expected to address the production of a NO Free Lunch documentary, development of a &#8220;Mouth of New Orleans&#8221; citizen-feedback web portal, and an ongoing series of &#8220;Breakfast with Boudreaux&#8221; talks to be streamed live on Mouth of New Orleans.</p>
<p>If you would like to receive NO Free Lunch, provide feedback, receive NO Free Lunch updates, or if you are a Lunch Professional interested in attending upcoming NO Free Lunch Conferences, please visit <a href="http://beckyhoutman.com/no-free-lunch/">MouthOfNewOrleans.com</a>.</p>

<p>Greetings from <a href="http://volgacity.com/">Volga, South Dakota</a> (The Town with a Future!), where I&#8217;m hard at work pissing off the local wildlife, along with my dad and my brother (they haven&#8217;t really been pissing off the wildlife &#8211; just me and my camera). This guy gave me an <a id="p67" href="http://beckyhoutman.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/prairie03.mp3">earful</a> for intruding on his territory (he&#8217;s the one that sounds like &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-headed_Blackbird">the grating of a rusty hinge</a>,&#8221; not the nice twittering by his friends in the background (not pictured)). He ought to have conceded me at least a little courtesy though, because he&#8217;s living on the <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1393/549882281_f1c8db4f4c.jpg">Houtman-DeBates Family Wildlife Area</a>, thanks to my Aunt Greta and her husband Larry &#8220;Uncle Bates&#8221; DeBates, who bought my grandparents&#8217; farm when they retired and eventually arranged a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_easement">perpetual conservation easement</a> for the property to revert to natural prairie and marsh.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know as much about conservation easements as I feel I should, and I think they vary somewhat from state to state, but it&#8217;s an interesting strategy to restore and preserve natural habitats. Owners who opt for an easement get tax incentives and retain title, control of access, and &#8220;compatible use&#8221; rights &#8211; hunting, fishing, trapping, etc. I have another uncle on my mother&#8217;s side who has a similar arrangement in Wisconsin, where he keeps bees and taps maple sap, among other things. They also get assistance restoring the property back to its natural state &#8211; burning off weeds, reintroducing native flora (hopefully fauna, like my angry friend above, follow too), restoring water exchange, or whatever else might be called for. And any new development or &#8220;non-compatible&#8221; use is prohibited for the life of the easement even if the title changes hands.</p>
<p>Louisiana&#8217;s DNR has a conservation easement program: the <a href="http://dnr.louisiana.gov/crm/coastres/cwrp.asp">Louisiana Coastal Wetland Reserve Program</a>. It&#8217;s a drop in the bucket of all the restoration Louisiana needs, I suppose, but every drop counts.</p>
<p>Now, off with the family to check out the Brookings, SD nightlife, which I suspect is not very wild&#8230;</p>

Maybe because it wasn&#8217;t exactly a stellar recovery &#8211; but then, that makes it all the more relevant to our own faltering steps. Of course, the comparison hasn&#8217;t been completely neglected &#8211; nosing around a bit, I turned up <a href="http://rs.resalliance.org/2006/03/11/recovering-new-orleans-the-resilient-city/">this post</a>, which in turn led to finding <a href="http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/6/">this video</a> of Diane E. Davis&#8217; lecture on Mexico City&#8217;s experience.</p>
<p>Do you have an hour or so to spare? <strong><a href="http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/6/">WATCH  THE VIDEO</a></strong>. The lecture portion is about 50 minutes long, with a 20 minute question and answer session following (although the sound isn&#8217;t great in that portion). Don&#8217;t have 50 minutes? Watch it in stages. I started jotting down a few notes about comments that seemed interesting or relevant to New Orleans&#8217; situation, and ended up with 4 1/2 pages. I&#8217;ll try not to go into excruciating detail, but the Mexico City experience is so much food for thought I expect I&#8217;ll be chewing on this for a long time to come. So rather than attempt a blow-by-blow comparison of similar events here and there, here are a few points that especially stood out for me (in no particular order):</p>
<blockquote><li>Responding to the title of the series, Davis argued that it&#8217;s not quite the case that <em>cities</em> are resilient. Rather, cities have multiple resiliencies, and some are less desirable than others. Corrupt intstitutions for instance, or violent crime. On the other hand, the resiliency of neighborhood and grassroots organizations was remarkable &#8211; even if they didn&#8217;t achieve everything they wanted or deserved, their political impact was definitely felt after the first faltering efforts that &#8220;followed the logic of money and power.&#8221; </p>
<li>Citizens asked, <em>&#8220;is it possible that we can believe in the efficacy of the government, when it was the people who did everything?&#8221;</em> Their questions were the beginning of the end of one-party rule, and did eventually bring about somewhat more participatory democratic institutions and greater accountibility.
<li>Questions about urban recovery shouldn&#8217;t be limited to <em>how</em> cities recover; we should also ask <em>what</em> they recover. Since the center of the city, the concentration of the political, social, historical, cultural, and economic character of the city as a whole, was most severely affected, what exactly that character was and what it should become were hotly contested.
<li>Failure to come up with a coherent, easily implementable recovery plan wasn&#8217;t due merely to the very real shortcomings of the local and national government of the time, but also to the competing priorities of different populations and the political pressure they applied. Less damaged areas pushed for more &#8220;macroeconomic&#8221; concerns while the homeless were still fighting for shelter; debates raged on whether low-income housing should be rebuilt in place, in long-standing downtown neighborhoods, or whether that would discourage higher-end downtown redevelopment with a focus on tourism and offices &#8211; again, the character of more than just buildings was at issue.
<li>There&#8217;s conflict inherent in recovery &#8211; ignoring that fact won&#8217;t make it go away.
<li>Dignity, <em>la dignidad</em>, was the rallying cry for citizens&#8217; groups. They lobbied for specific material needs as well, and for government accountibility, but the recovery of dignity was the vital underpinning of all those efforts.
<li>Although admirable concessions were achieved in housing policy, distribution of housing and assistance were still uneven in some respects, and that unevenness has had long-lasting effects, including exacerbating violent rivalries among street vendors, and the persistance of tent cities for years in some areas.
<li>Many downtown hotels and private office buildings were left unattended for years to come. There&#8217;s been a resurgence of activity and investment in the area more recently, but there are still spots here and there, two or three blocks in size, that have been untouched since 1985, just a stone&#8217;s throw from thriving, rebuilt districts.</li>
</blockquote>
<p>I could go on and on, but I&#8217;ll stop myself for now. I&#8217;m curious to know what anyone else thinks about the lecture, or about the Mexico City recovery experience in general.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68076016@N00/495161046/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/196/495161046_b1bc14c03e.jpg" width="425" height="89" alt="L 99 99 99" /></a></p>
<p>That was more or less what my screen looked like the other day when I attempted to boot up. The 99&#8242;s ran to almost half the screen, taunting me without so much as an obscure command prompt or any sort of option whatsoever. I did what any sensible person would do &#8211; flew into a blind panic. What was this? Some hideous new White Album virus? Was the Number 9 all I&#8217;d ever see again on this machine (well, an L too, but that wasn&#8217;t very reassuring)? <a href="http://www.turnmeondeadman.net/IBP/Revolution9.php">Turn me on dead man</a>, indeed.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t. Thankfully, after laboriously accessing google through on my teeny-weeny cell phone screen, I found (and was actually able to read, after a fashion) <a href="http://notpopular.com/blogs/josh/2006/02/23/l-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99/">this post</a>, which reassured me that this was not a virus or any such thing &#8211; just a hexadecimal error message. Thanks a million, Josh Highlands Blog &#8211; or rather, thanks 99 99 99. I had uninstalled Linux some weeks earlier, and long story really short, my Master Boot Record was exposed somehow to overwriting or something like that. Unfortunately, IBM Thinkpads don&#8217;t come with a Windows CD &#8211; in their infinite wisdom, they put the rescue and recovery business on the hard drive, in a special hidden &#8220;pre-desktop&#8221; area for those idiots who misplace their Windows disks. Well, the pre-desktop area was exactly what I couldn&#8217;t access, and although once upon a time I&#8217;d made my own set of recovery disks, I&#8217;m that idiot who misplaced them (I&#8217;m not even sure that they would have done the trick). Booting from an installation disk and running FIXMBR was not going to be quite so easy.</p>
<p>I called around to see if anyone else I knew with Windows XP still had their installation disks, but wasn&#8217;t having any luck, and I kept scouring the web for any alternative solutions. Fortunately, after I got crabbier and crabbier, <a href="http://blogometer.com/">Alan</a> found a solution while I was at the grocery store, muttering Luddite curses under my breath, and I&#8217;m back in action again.</p>
<p>Of course, this L 99 99 99 business isn&#8217;t really the fault of Linux. After all, it came <em>after</em> the uninstall &#8211; well after. I&#8217;ve dabbled with Linux for several years, and for relatively long stretches of time I&#8217;ve used it as my primary OS. I&#8217;ve sung the praises of Open Source (and still do), and I&#8217;ve even enjoyed the many challenges of finding and installing the appropriate drivers to make fiddly hardware work. I found I wasn&#8217;t one to relaxen und watchen das blinkenlights, and gefingerpoken und mittengrabben have brought me close to schnappen der springenwerk, blowenfusen und poppencorken mit spitzensparken more than once. Ironically, my first installation was by far the easiest, and they&#8217;ve gotten more difficult with each subsequent PC. Then again, the next attempts were on laptops, which are notoriously trickier. But I soldiered on, skirting disaster with partitioning tools and bootloaders and reams of competing advice, and generally came out OK.  I always kept a Windows partition as well, for the occasional bit of software that had no Open Source alternative, but rarely needed it. Until I went wireless.</p>
<p>I combed all the Linux for Laptop advice I could find, scoured everyone&#8217;s accounts of their installs on IBM T-series ThinkPads, and tried every avenue I could find. I&#8217;d battled with the &#8220;winmodem&#8221; issue in my first Linux install, which I ended up &#8220;solving&#8221; by buying a new modem (at 28.8, it was badly needing an upgrade by then anyway). It just wouldn&#8217;t work. Plugging in to DSL worked just fine, but I don&#8217;t have a laptop to just leave it tethered in one place, so I used the dearly-bought Linux partition less and less. I suppose by now there might be a solution, but I was just worn out with the constant searching required to catch my hardware up every time I upgraded. The Linux world is friendly enough not to throw around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a> too often, but I&#8217;ve often wished there actually <em>was</em> an F-ing Manual somewhere. But Moses hasn&#8217;t come down from the mountain with that quite yet. Between the myriad flavors of GNU/Linux and the myriad flavors of hardware that vary even within the same make and model of PC, even the most patient, detailed, step-by-step accounts weren&#8217;t always enough for someone like me.</p>
<p>I like to think I&#8217;m a relatively savvy user, but I&#8217;m no system administrator, and I&#8217;ve spun my wheels in perpetual &#8220;newbie&#8221; status. In fact, I think I&#8217;ve aged out of newbie, and I&#8217;m reduced to Linux Dilettante (Linuttante?). Not that I haven&#8217;t learned quite a bit about the Man Behind the Curtain by having to solve Linux installation problems, but I just don&#8217;t have the time and attention to spare any longer. I&#8217;ve had to admit defeat. Temporary, I hope. I&#8217;m back to cursing and fuming at XP, but at least I&#8217;m <em>online</em> cursing and fuming.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not a permanent abandonment &#8211; I keep hearing that the Linux desktop market is growing, which would seem to mean that the hardware and software conflicts that frustrate more &#8220;casual&#8221; users are getting sorted out faster and better, but then again, the immanent Linux desktop explosion has been &#8220;just around the corner&#8221; <a href="http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci1108050,00.html">for years</a>.</p>
<p>So, <em>Fare thee well my OS Linux, / And farewell for a while.</em></p>

			<p>OK, I can&#8217;t come up with a New Orleans Recovery palindrome. I tried my hand at some anagrams though, and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve come up with so far:</p>
<blockquote><li>Mayor of New Orleans &#8211; <em>A sworn loony re fame.</em></p>
<li>Parish Recovery Council  &#8211; <em>A cyclone: ouch, rivers rip.</em>
<li>Unified New Orleans Plan &#8211; <em>A serene fill-in. Own up: nada.</em>
<li>Army Corps of Engineers &#8211; <em>If errors, spongy menace.</em></li>
</blockquote>
<p>Best I could do. I&#8217;m no Nabokov.</p>
<p>But down to business now, The Man is Recovery Czar Ed Blakely, The Plans are the ones we&#8217;re all too familiar with already, plus the new addition of Blakely&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-8/1175234089230740.xml&#38;coll=1">&#8220;It&#8217;s not my plan, it&#8217;s the people&#8217;s plan,&#8221;</a> and The Canals, well &#8211; if the powers that be don&#8217;t start listening to vox clamantis <a href="http://fixthepumps.blogspot.com/">Matt McBride</a>, the unholy waters will flow again and the plans won&#8217;t be worth the paper they&#8217;re written on.</p>
<p>My initial reaction to Blakely&#8217;s announcement of his 17 target zones was, like that of some <a href="http://vatul.net/blog/index.php/1262/">fellow</a> <a href="http://adrastos.blog-city.com/baby_steps.htm">bloggers</a> who were (as usual) quicker on the uptake than me, optimistic, if guardedly so. It&#8217;s reassuring to see a commitment to the severely devastated 9th Ward and New Orleans East, and the distribution of the &#8220;Redevelop&#8221; and &#8220;Renew&#8221; areas seems reasonable. And it&#8217;s fair of Blakely to observe that New Orleans doesn&#8217;t have the best record when it comes to finishing projects, and as nice as it would be to address everything that needs attention immediately, chances are that would lead to nothing getting done at all, anywhere. (That said, it would be worthwhile if Blakely and his Parishwide Recovery Committee would let on which areas are under consideration for Phase 2 and beyond &#8211; lots more neighborhoods&#8217; futures hang in the balance, and they deserve some idea of what to expect and when.)</p>
<p>Despite my hope that the announcement means that these 17 zones will see some real action in the near future, my optimism guard, as I mentioned, is up and fully armed. As <a href="http://librarychronicles.blogspot.com/2007_03_01_archive.html#5352769353200889663">Library Chronicles</a> points out, the Blakely Plan isn&#8217;t much longer on specifics than anything else we&#8217;ve seen (and the financing is fishy: notably the <a href="http://www.squanderedheritage.com/2007/03/29/national-public-radio/">&#8220;blight bonds&#8221;</a> and the unlikely waiver of the requirement of the 10% match for FEMA projects). There&#8217;s a general opacity to it that doesn&#8217;t augur well if it continues.</p>
<p>A Recovery Czar who says in response to reporters&#8217; inquiries about what development in the 17 zones might look like:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have a very clear idea&#8221; of how the zones will develop, he said. &#8220;Developers make a lot of money by getting those clear ideas early and getting the jump in the game. And that shouldn&#8217;t happen in the newspaper. You&#8217;re a newspaper reporter, not a developer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>and a Mayor who follows (not surprisingly) with:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get into specific dates and specific projects with you guys because I know what you do with that: You come back later and you talk about the things that we haven&#8217;t done.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>don&#8217;t sound like executors of a &#8220;people&#8217;s plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for that matter, I haven&#8217;t yet found a comprehensive list of who is serving on the Parishwide Recovery Committee, or when and where their future meetings will be held (I would think their proceedings would fall under the requirements of Louisiana&#8217;s Open Meetings Law). Also, Blakely has called the UNOP <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-20/1173338817274060.xml&#38;coll=1&#38;thispage=2">&#8220;a critical part of [the] process&#8221;</a> (falling somewhat short of explicitly endorsing it &#8211; and while we&#8217;re on that topic, is the Parishwide Recovery <em>Committee</em> the same as the Parishwide Recovery <em>Council</em>, or is it a pointed snub? I&#8217;ve seen it referred to as both), and he seems to invoke it as the basis of calling it &#8220;the people&#8217;s plan,&#8221; but if the UNOP and/or other previous planning efforts are going to be the sum-total of public participation, I&#8217;m concerned. Not that I think we need to be put through any more magic-marker-and-red-dot exercises, but the UNOP has its share of woolly bits that could be stretched to fit plenty of interpretations of &#8220;the will of the people.&#8221; The public deserves comment periods and scrutiny of plan particulars in the media, mainstream- and citizen-varieties. Any developers worth their salt should be able to cope with that.</p>
<p>So, my fingers are crossed that we can get some positive action without more secrecy, otherwise, I&#8217;m afraid New Orleans Recovery = CRoWN EVERYONE A LOSER (OK, I cheated on that one &#8211; it was just too close to resist).</p>

<p>With all the recent fuss over <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-7/1174110117308800.xml&#38;coll=1">&#8220;rebuilding&#8221; vs &#8220;compensation&#8221;</a> regarding Road Home payments and CDBG regulations, I was surprised to hear yesterday that Phase II of Mississippi&#8217;s Homeowner Assistance Program (HAP) is basing its grant calculations on cost to <em>rebuild</em>.</p>
<p>I wrote about the &#8220;worst of both worlds&#8221; scenario Louisiana&#8217;s Road Home Program was facing the other day at <a href="http://thinknola.com/blog/think/2007/03/18/hud-roadblock-for-road-home-rebuilding-vs-compensation/">Think New Orleans</a>: in a nutshell, the LRA was allegedly told when designing the RHP that they had to cap awards at the pre-Katrina appraised value of the home even if the estimated cost to repair/rebuild was greater, because basing awards on rebuilding costs would make it, aptly enough, a &#8220;rebuilding program&#8221; and thereby trigger torrents of onerous requirements and regulations. And just lately, HUD &#8220;discovered&#8221; that the <em>method</em> of Road Home payments constituted a &#8220;rebuilding program&#8221; as well &#8211; maximum burden for the minimum award.</p>
<p>Mississippi&#8217;s HAP is using a phased approach: Phase I was for homeowners <em>with</em> homeowners insurance (although not necessarily flood insurance) living outside the pre-Katrina FEMA designated flood zone. Like the Road Home, it also had an ultimate $150,000 cap, and beneath that cap, the upper limit was based on the value of the home &#8211; in this case, the <em>insured</em> value of the home, <em>plus 35%</em>. Meaning that, should the damage estimate, determined by the method described above, exceed the insured value of the home (or the appraised value, for that matter), a higher award could be calculated. What exactly is being &#8220;compensated&#8221; here, that&#8217;s not compensable in Louisiana?</p>
<li><a href="http://www.mshomehelp.gov/faq.pdf">HAP Phase I FAQs</a>
<li><a href="http://www.hud.gov/content/releases/pr06-036ms.pdf">HUD-approved MDA Partial Action Plan (including HAP Phase I)</a>. Interestingly, this action plan doesn&#8217;t mention the additional 35% specified in the offical FAQs. I haven&#8217;t been able to find when and how that became part of the program.</li>
<p>Phase II is directed at homeowners with a household income beneath 120% AMI with Hurricane Katrina storm surge damage. The HUD-approved action plan makes no mention of insured or appraised value. This award is capped at $100,000, but up to that amount, the award is based exclusively on the official damage assessment &#8211; insured homeowners receiving 100% of the estimate, uninsured receiving 70%. And yet, &#8220;In consultation with HUD, and due to the nature and design of the Homeowner Assistance Grant Program, the State has determined through its environmental review that project level actions are categorically excluded and not subject to related laws for Phase II.&#8221; No NEPA.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.mshomehelp.gov/p2_action_plan.pdf">HUD-approved Phase II Action Plan</a></li>
<p>I don&#8217;t begrudge Mississippians any additional money they may be awarded via their damage assessments; I also wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the assessments were erratic or out of sync with today&#8217;s real costs of rebuilding, as the rest of the Mississippi Press article cited above suggests. But I&#8217;d really like to understand why Louisiana can&#8217;t have similar latitude for the Road Home. Granted, there are a number of other differences between the programs, some of which may influence which requirements might apply, but on their faces, <em>both</em> states&#8217; programs have very explicit rebuilding components, sometimes favoring rebuilding over relocating, and as far as I can tell, the only difference between &#8220;rebuilding&#8221; (i.e. triggers-multitudes-of-onerous-regulations) and &#8220;compensation&#8221; (i.e. you-might-get-some-money-in-this-lifetime) is smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>Was the LRA Housing Committee really too thick to rephrase their &#8220;compensation&#8221; package to permit greater consideration of rebuilding costs? Is there some secret catch to Mississippi&#8217;s plan that would make its rebuilding-cost &#8220;compensatory&#8221; provisions unfavorable to Louisianans somehow? Or does the fact that the nebulous nature of CDBGs requires negotiating with HUD, currently headed by Alphonso &#8220;heck of a crony&#8221; Jackson, mean that our marginally-Blue State will be held to a different standard no matter what we do? Or is it some combintion of all three?</p>
<p>Or am I completely missing the point?</p>
