			<h3>May 12th, 2007</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="entrybody">
			<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68076016@N00/495161046/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/196/495161046_b1bc14c03e.jpg" width="425" height="89" alt="L 99 99 99" /></a></p>
<p>That was more or less what my screen looked like the other day when I attempted to boot up. The 99&#8242;s ran to almost half the screen, taunting me without so much as an obscure command prompt or any sort of option whatsoever. I did what any sensible person would do &#8211; flew into a blind panic. What was this? Some hideous new White Album virus? Was the Number 9 all I&#8217;d ever see again on this machine (well, an L too, but that wasn&#8217;t very reassuring)? <a href="http://www.turnmeondeadman.net/IBP/Revolution9.php">Turn me on dead man</a>, indeed.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t. Thankfully, after laboriously accessing google through on my teeny-weeny cell phone screen, I found (and was actually able to read, after a fashion) <a href="http://notpopular.com/blogs/josh/2006/02/23/l-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99-99/">this post</a>, which reassured me that this was not a virus or any such thing &#8211; just a hexadecimal error message. Thanks a million, Josh Highlands Blog &#8211; or rather, thanks 99 99 99. I had uninstalled Linux some weeks earlier, and long story really short, my Master Boot Record was exposed somehow to overwriting or something like that. Unfortunately, IBM Thinkpads don&#8217;t come with a Windows CD &#8211; in their infinite wisdom, they put the rescue and recovery business on the hard drive, in a special hidden &#8220;pre-desktop&#8221; area for those idiots who misplace their Windows disks. Well, the pre-desktop area was exactly what I couldn&#8217;t access, and although once upon a time I&#8217;d made my own set of recovery disks, I&#8217;m that idiot who misplaced them (I&#8217;m not even sure that they would have done the trick). Booting from an installation disk and running FIXMBR was not going to be quite so easy.</p>
<p>I called around to see if anyone else I knew with Windows XP still had their installation disks, but wasn&#8217;t having any luck, and I kept scouring the web for any alternative solutions. Fortunately, after I got crabbier and crabbier, <a href="http://blogometer.com/">Alan</a> found a solution while I was at the grocery store, muttering Luddite curses under my breath, and I&#8217;m back in action again.</p>
<p>Of course, this L 99 99 99 business isn&#8217;t really the fault of Linux. After all, it came <em>after</em> the uninstall &#8211; well after. I&#8217;ve dabbled with Linux for several years, and for relatively long stretches of time I&#8217;ve used it as my primary OS. I&#8217;ve sung the praises of Open Source (and still do), and I&#8217;ve even enjoyed the many challenges of finding and installing the appropriate drivers to make fiddly hardware work. I found I wasn&#8217;t one to relaxen und watchen das blinkenlights, and gefingerpoken und mittengrabben have brought me close to schnappen der springenwerk, blowenfusen und poppencorken mit spitzensparken more than once. Ironically, my first installation was by far the easiest, and they&#8217;ve gotten more difficult with each subsequent PC. Then again, the next attempts were on laptops, which are notoriously trickier. But I soldiered on, skirting disaster with partitioning tools and bootloaders and reams of competing advice, and generally came out OK.  I always kept a Windows partition as well, for the occasional bit of software that had no Open Source alternative, but rarely needed it. Until I went wireless.</p>
<p>I combed all the Linux for Laptop advice I could find, scoured everyone&#8217;s accounts of their installs on IBM T-series ThinkPads, and tried every avenue I could find. I&#8217;d battled with the &#8220;winmodem&#8221; issue in my first Linux install, which I ended up &#8220;solving&#8221; by buying a new modem (at 28.8, it was badly needing an upgrade by then anyway). It just wouldn&#8217;t work. Plugging in to DSL worked just fine, but I don&#8217;t have a laptop to just leave it tethered in one place, so I used the dearly-bought Linux partition less and less. I suppose by now there might be a solution, but I was just worn out with the constant searching required to catch my hardware up every time I upgraded. The Linux world is friendly enough not to throw around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a> too often, but I&#8217;ve often wished there actually <em>was</em> an F-ing Manual somewhere. But Moses hasn&#8217;t come down from the mountain with that quite yet. Between the myriad flavors of GNU/Linux and the myriad flavors of hardware that vary even within the same make and model of PC, even the most patient, detailed, step-by-step accounts weren&#8217;t always enough for someone like me.</p>
<p>I like to think I&#8217;m a relatively savvy user, but I&#8217;m no system administrator, and I&#8217;ve spun my wheels in perpetual &#8220;newbie&#8221; status. In fact, I think I&#8217;ve aged out of newbie, and I&#8217;m reduced to Linux Dilettante (Linuttante?). Not that I haven&#8217;t learned quite a bit about the Man Behind the Curtain by having to solve Linux installation problems, but I just don&#8217;t have the time and attention to spare any longer. I&#8217;ve had to admit defeat. Temporary, I hope. I&#8217;m back to cursing and fuming at XP, but at least I&#8217;m <em>online</em> cursing and fuming.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not a permanent abandonment &#8211; I keep hearing that the Linux desktop market is growing, which would seem to mean that the hardware and software conflicts that frustrate more &#8220;casual&#8221; users are getting sorted out faster and better, but then again, the immanent Linux desktop explosion has been &#8220;just around the corner&#8221; <a href="http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci1108050,00.html">for years</a>.</p>
<p>So, <em>Fare thee well my OS Linux, / And farewell for a while.</em></p>

			<p>This is interesting.</p>
<p>Ms Houtman never heard of a LiveCD distro&#8230; or system backups for that matter, even after claiming to have &#8220;years&#8221; of &#8220;Linux&#8221; experience.</p>
<p>Well, all I know is that after getting my Linux distro the way I want, I will NEVER &#8211; EVER, go back to that nightmare called Windows.</p>

			<p>Hmmmm. Mr Smith seems to have overlooked the part where I admitted I never felt like I made it past &#8220;newbie&#8221; status. Most of my &#8220;years&#8221; of &#8220;Linux&#8221; experience were (happily) spent doing boring user stuff like composing documents, sending email, editing photos and whatnot. It wasn&#8217;t every day that I wrestled with the deep dark secrets of the Kernel. Computers are tools, not ends in themselves, and when Linux was good it was very very good, but when I couldn&#8217;t configure my wireless card after numerous attempts, the tool wasn&#8217;t doing the job I needed it to do.</p>
<p>(By the way: Yes, I have actually heard of system backups (and done a few), but that didn&#8217;t help me in this case.</p>
<p>No, I hadn&#8217;t heard of a LiveCD distro (must have missed that part of the F-ing Manual). Thanks for pointing it out. Should I ever have the time to test even more Linux distros for essential hardware compatibility, I&#8217;ll keep that in mind.)</p>

			<p>An awkward nastygram.</p>
<p>If Ms Houtman claimed ten years of Mac experience, it would not follow that she&#8217;d have to have had booted from CD, imaged her parititions, or would even have had to make a choice of distrubtion. Those are exactly the sort of experiences that keep Linux sitting on the shelf in the desktop market, like a crystal radio set among the Harmon/Kardons.</p>
<p>If there is any reason to avoid Linux, it&#8217;s the sinvielling alpha-nerd mentality where a failure to boot elicits scorn and not sympathy.</p>
<p>Getting a Linux distro the way you want? The implication of that statement is that it takes time. A lot of time. It takes hours watching a bash shell spew gcc output. Shinny objects. Not really a contribution to the state of the art.</p>
<p>You built your own operating system. Why? That&#8217;s like churing your own butter.</p>
<p>Admit that it&#8217;s a hobby and we&#8217;re good.</p>
