		<p>I never thought that an article in the national press purporting to feature the pioneering spirits of New Orleanians returning to the most ravaged neighborhoods against all odds, exhibiting the enormous resolve of &#8220;ordinary&#8221; citizens to restore their homes and their dignity whether deserved assistance comes or no, could raise my hackles. But leave it to <a href="http://thinknola.com/post/is-adam-nossiter-a-tool/">Adam Nossiter</a> to prove me wrong. I don&#8217;t have it in me right now to go over the article in detail and how, in the guise of shedding a faint ray of light on the triumphs and struggles of New Orleans citizens, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/us/nationalspecial/02orleans.html?hp">Largely Alone, Pioneers Reclaim New Orleans</a> presents the opportunity to highlight the worst of what&#8217;s happening here and confirm a stereotypical hopelessness arising from the citizenry&#8217;s boundless ineptitude. Which isn&#8217;t to say that the crime rate, the state of public schools, and the planning leadership aren&#8217;t abysmal or bordering on it, but the article conveniently neglects to illustrate the of citizen-led efforts to decry and confront those problems the same way citizens confront the restoration of their physical homes. I&#8217;ll leave one particularly pungent quote to make my case: &#8220;only about one in five [Road Home] applicants &#8211; <em>most of them entitled to it</em> &#8211; have actually received money&#8221; (emphasis mine). <em>Most of them entitled to it.</em> What a pithy summation of the worst sort of condescension. Thanks, Mr. Nossiter, for your gracious observation that New Orleans isn&#8217;t <em>mostly</em> frauds and thieves.</p>        <a href="http://beckyhoutman.com/2007/07/01/never-say-never/"> Comments (0)</a>         </div>

			<blockquote><p>The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, &#8216;Never mind, cut it off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.&#8217; So the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe, and went to the king&#8217;s son. &#8211; <em>Ashputtel</em> (Cinderella), <em><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2591">Grimm&#8217;s Fairy Tales</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The F-word is in the air again. Or rather, it&#8217;s conspicuously <em>not</em> in the air, since the BNOB taught everyone what a dirty word <em>footprint</em> could be. Now, the buzz is about unrestrained rebuilding in &#8220;risky&#8221; areas, thanks in particular to the Washington Post&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/03/AR2007010301593.html">New Orleans Repeats Mistakes as it Rebuilds</a> article yesterday. The blogosphere is once again <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&#38;ie=UTF-8&#38;q=%22New+Orleans+Repeats+Mistakes+as+It+Rebuilds%22&#38;btnG=Search+Blogs">awash</a> in &#8220;why are we letting those idiots spend <em>our</em> to rebuild below sea level?&#8221; rants (note, though, <a href="http://fematrailer.blogspot.com/2007/01/will-they-ever-stop.html">mominem&#8217;s</a> lonely voice of dissent ranked on the first page of Google&#8217;s blogsearch). Oddly enough, the Post&#8217;s previous day&#8217;s story on Sacramento&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/03/AR2007010302037.html">potentially catastrophic flood risk</a>, observing that (surprise) it&#8217;s levees are substandard, didn&#8217;t warrant much <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&#38;ie=UTF-8&#38;q=sacramento+flood+washington+post&#38;as_maxm=&#38;as_miny=2007&#38;as_maxy=&#38;as_minm=1&#38;as_mind=3&#38;as_maxd=&#38;as_drrb=b&#38;ctz=360&#38;c1cr=1%2F3%2F2007&#38;c2cr=&#38;btnD=Go">blogland comment</a> that I&#8217;ve been able to find.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t give the footprint topic the time of day if it were confined to knee-jerk New Orleans haters who think that our massive losses are costing them somehow, as if some enormous Save New Orleans tax were being levied on them personally. But I&#8217;ve heard the variations on the &#8220;you have to shrink the footprint&#8221; line from too many friends and relatives out of town &#8211; people who sincerely love New Orleans, visit here, visit more than just the French Quarter and Jazz Fest Fairgrounds, and want the city to survive almost as desperately as we residents do &#8211; to brush it off.</p>
<p>After all, it does seem eminently logical both to consolidate the population for the sake of providing services, and to run like hell from the worst-flooded areas. It&#8217;s true that we can&#8217;t expect to come back to pre-Katrina population density any time soon, if ever (and no one here wants their neighborhood to suffer the jack-o-lantern fate, or be surrounded by blight and vacant lots), and it&#8217;s completely fair to ask why one should rebuild in the deepest flood-risk zones. The trouble is, I&#8217;ve never seen the inevitable, costly consequences of a smaller footprint adequately addressed, even if race and class inequities could be somehow swept aside. And it <em>does</em> cost. It&#8217;s not an abstracted matter of so many puzzle pieces to be shuffled around, or cars in a valet parking lot. It&#8217;s a question of where real people can live, and how we can afford to make decent housing available in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Even the UNOP&#8217;s Community Congress II acknowledged that one of the &#8220;cons&#8221; of the scenario of requiring people to resettle in ill-defined &#8220;clusters&#8221; was the greater cost than letting people rebuild where they lived before. If you think the <a href="http://thinknola.com/wiki/Citizen%27s_Road_Home_Action_Team">Road Home</a> program is falling short now, just imagine when homeowners are forced to take the buyout offer rather than renovate/rebuild, and the real costs of relocation come to the fore. I&#8217;m a little surprised that the <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate/act.htm">Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act</a> hasn&#8217;t been invoked yet, given that it&#8217;s a federal project that deprived the majority of New Orleans of their homes, but you can be sure that if or when people are denied the option to rebuild, the meaning and value of &#8220;comparable replacement dwelling&#8221; in the post-Katrina real estate market will be a magma-hot flashpoint.</p>
<p>Plenty of pundits (including Recovery Chief Ed Blakely, cited in the Post article) have proposed some vague sort of &#8220;lot swap&#8221; between badly flooded homeowners who want to return and scarcely flooded homeowners who have left, but would someone please show me these high-ground lots ready and waiting to be swapped? I know there are lots of people with high-ground properties who have relocated to other cities due to work or disgust, but which are the ones who aren&#8217;t seeking their newly boosted market value? What do we honestly have to offer people who are willing to sacrifice their immediate sense of home: their house or apartment, for their general sense of home: New Orleans? (Incidentally, the Post article notes that &#8220;Officials in St. Bernard Parish &#8230; rejected closing off a particularly hard-hit 36-block section of Chalmette because they could not afford to buy out property owners.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t influence their conclusion that we&#8217;re Repeating Mistakes as We Rebuild, though.)</p>
<p>Another glaring omission from the footprint argument is the acknowledgement that ours was an <em>un</em>natural disaster, and that that fact figures significantly into both what risk property owners and dwellers thought they were assuming before Katrina, and what risk we&#8217;re facing after. The Post does acknowledges that &#8220;the levees &#8230; proved catastrophically fallible,&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t factor in what every local now knows &#8211; that our degree of risk has far less to do with elevation than with the x-factor of where the next breaches might occur. Given that so far, the levees have been repaired mainly where they breached, and that miles of levees are still as substandard as before, everywhere <em>but</em> the repaired breaches will be under the same strain as before should a Katrina-like event happen again, with no telling which spots might give way first. And heaven forbid that the next threat should come via the river rather than canals to the lake, because then the highest, &#8220;safest&#8221; ground will be obliterated. We just can&#8217;t evaluate true flood risk while it&#8217;s more contingent on man-made negligence than natural vulnerability.</p>
<p>And encompassing both the population-consolidation issue and the flood-risk issue is the self-fulfilling prophecy dilemma. Repopulation is a matter of both just compensation to those who lost their homes and everything in them, and prevention of becoming a theme-park rather than a city. People weren&#8217;t stupid or foolhardy to choose to live and work in New Orleans, any more than people are stupid or foolhardy to live in Sacramento, San Francisco, or any coast, riverside, lakeside, barrier island, earthquake zone, tornado-swept prairie, blizzard, or avalanche territory. Offering and encouraging the option of return to the people who were flooded out is a moral imperative as well as an imperative to preserve the viability &#8211; not just of neighborhoods &#8211; but of the city. We need our population to back our deserved political clout at the state and federal level, and to remain a diverse city &#8211; racially, industrially, and economically. To retreat to the Sliver by the River is to cement our past history of inequality into an even more go-nowhere status as a low-wage, low-opportunity tourism town; a barely-get-by-ism that we <em>will</em> deserve to lose to another hurricane if <em>we&#8217;re</em> the ones who let it happen.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no Fairy Godmother to tell us how to deal with flood risk and population shrinkage, but more importantly, there&#8217;s no Prince Charming who will take care of everything if we only make ourselves fit someone&#8217;s idea of what size slipper we should wear. We have excruciating decisions to make, but no one is in a position to tell us which toes can do without, any more than the knee-jerk New Orleans haters can say that the nation can do without us &#8211; our neighborhoods are no more socio-economic islands than we are as a city or a region. Nor can anyone tell us that sacrificing the 9th Ward, Lakeview, Hollygrove, Gert Town, or any of the flooded neighborhoods will make us a Queen who won&#8217;t need or want to walk. We&#8217;ll be crying &#8220;let them eat bread pudding&#8221; all the way to the guillotine if it ever comes to that.</p>

			<p>I posted my <a href="http://beckyhoutman.com/2006/07/30/unified-new-orleans-plan-my-take-so-far-on-11-months-of-development/">Unified New Orleans Plan</a> on the <a href="http://thinknola.com/wiki/Unified_New_Orleans_Plan">New Orleans Wiki</a> tonight, edited a bit, and with a little more on what&#8217;s been happening since. The meeting descriptions could stand some fleshing out, especially since I played hooky on Tuesday to attend a couple Night Out Against Crime events in my area: the <a href="http://adrastos.blog-city.com/picture_time_night_out_on_napoleon.htm">Bouligny Riverside-Faubourg Marengo-Faubourg Delachaise Triumvirate</a>, and my own hood, <a href="http://tourobouligny.com/2006/07/05/touro-bouligny-neighborhood-block-party/">Touro Bouligny</a>. I&#8217;m pleased to say that there were no long lines to get in, I didn&#8217;t have to put a red dot on anything, and the noise level was quite pleasant.</p>
<p>Anyway, if anyone has an corrections to make or anything to add to the wiki article as the process stumbles along, more editors would be much appreciated (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page">wiki markup instructions</a> if you&#8217;ve never done it before). Or leave me a comment and I&#8217;ll add it in.</p>

			<h3>July 24th, 2006</h3>

			<p>It&#8217;s come to my <a href="http://bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=7673">attention</a> that last Friday, the New Orleans Community Support Foundation selected its contenders for the technical help teams that neighborhood and planning district groups will be able to choose from. Since the NOCSF was set up to administer use of a $3.5 million Rockefeller Foundation planning grant and direct the use of the recovery funds Congress has approved, this is hardly a small matter. This meeting also established the schedule and procedure for community members to get involved &#8211; a meeting on Sunday, July 30, 2:00-6:00PM was announced (location To Be Determined) at which residents can meet the prospective planners, settle on criteria for working with them, and determine their neighborhoods&#8217; and/or districts&#8217; official boundaries. A second meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, August 1, at which attendees can pick their top three choices for their groups&#8217; assintance teams. Again, not trivial things. But where was this announcement made? As far as I&#8217;ve been able to determine, the only local media to publish the date and details was <a href="http://bayoubuzz.com/">BayouBuzz</a>. The Times-Picayune did cover <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/metro/index.ssf?/base/news-16/115354836683610.xml&#38;coll=1">last Friday&#8217;s panel meeting</a>, but nothing further about meeting times or agendas, despite generalizations about the &#8220;strong voice&#8221; neighborhoods will have in their own planning processes. As for other local media, I&#8217;ve poked around a bit, but haven&#8217;t turned anything up as of yet. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much extra room in the &#8220;Local News&#8221; segments these days when Dr. Anna Pou is on the loose. To their credit, the NOCSF did post the meeting info on their <a href="www.unifiedneworleansplan.org/meetings.html">website</a>, and they say they&#8217;ve disseminated the information to untold numbers of community groups &#8211; I hope they have. I hope they really are serious about including our numerous community groups in their own rebuilding efforts. I&#8217;m pleased to see how many local firms made the list &#8211; that&#8217;s a step in the right direction. But I&#8217;m still a bit concerend &#8211; where are the other local media on this? Where is the NOCSF when it comes to leaning on the local media if they won&#8217;t pick it up on their own? How much faith can we put in a planning commission whose primary outreach tool is a <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.org/happening.html">content-shy</a> website that already needs some of its links retooled (try navigating off the <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.org/contactus.php">&#8220;Contact Us&#8221;</a> page, for example)? How far can we rely on an organization that doesn&#8217;t even have a location settled for a meeting less than a week away? That gives the community less than a week&#8217;s notice for that meeting? Cross your fingers, and register to attend&#8230;</p>
