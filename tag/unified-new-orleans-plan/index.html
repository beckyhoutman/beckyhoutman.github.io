			<p>OK, I can&#8217;t come up with a New Orleans Recovery palindrome. I tried my hand at some anagrams though, and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve come up with so far:</p>
<blockquote><li>Mayor of New Orleans &#8211; <em>A sworn loony re fame.</em></p>
<li>Parish Recovery Council  &#8211; <em>A cyclone: ouch, rivers rip.</em>
<li>Unified New Orleans Plan &#8211; <em>A serene fill-in. Own up: nada.</em>
<li>Army Corps of Engineers &#8211; <em>If errors, spongy menace.</em></li>
</blockquote>
<p>Best I could do. I&#8217;m no Nabokov.</p>
<p>But down to business now, The Man is Recovery Czar Ed Blakely, The Plans are the ones we&#8217;re all too familiar with already, plus the new addition of Blakely&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-8/1175234089230740.xml&#38;coll=1">&#8220;It&#8217;s not my plan, it&#8217;s the people&#8217;s plan,&#8221;</a> and The Canals, well &#8211; if the powers that be don&#8217;t start listening to vox clamantis <a href="http://fixthepumps.blogspot.com/">Matt McBride</a>, the unholy waters will flow again and the plans won&#8217;t be worth the paper they&#8217;re written on.</p>
<p>My initial reaction to Blakely&#8217;s announcement of his 17 target zones was, like that of some <a href="http://vatul.net/blog/index.php/1262/">fellow</a> <a href="http://adrastos.blog-city.com/baby_steps.htm">bloggers</a> who were (as usual) quicker on the uptake than me, optimistic, if guardedly so. It&#8217;s reassuring to see a commitment to the severely devastated 9th Ward and New Orleans East, and the distribution of the &#8220;Redevelop&#8221; and &#8220;Renew&#8221; areas seems reasonable. And it&#8217;s fair of Blakely to observe that New Orleans doesn&#8217;t have the best record when it comes to finishing projects, and as nice as it would be to address everything that needs attention immediately, chances are that would lead to nothing getting done at all, anywhere. (That said, it would be worthwhile if Blakely and his Parishwide Recovery Committee would let on which areas are under consideration for Phase 2 and beyond &#8211; lots more neighborhoods&#8217; futures hang in the balance, and they deserve some idea of what to expect and when.)</p>
<p>Despite my hope that the announcement means that these 17 zones will see some real action in the near future, my optimism guard, as I mentioned, is up and fully armed. As <a href="http://librarychronicles.blogspot.com/2007_03_01_archive.html#5352769353200889663">Library Chronicles</a> points out, the Blakely Plan isn&#8217;t much longer on specifics than anything else we&#8217;ve seen (and the financing is fishy: notably the <a href="http://www.squanderedheritage.com/2007/03/29/national-public-radio/">&#8220;blight bonds&#8221;</a> and the unlikely waiver of the requirement of the 10% match for FEMA projects). There&#8217;s a general opacity to it that doesn&#8217;t augur well if it continues.</p>
<p>A Recovery Czar who says in response to reporters&#8217; inquiries about what development in the 17 zones might look like:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have a very clear idea&#8221; of how the zones will develop, he said. &#8220;Developers make a lot of money by getting those clear ideas early and getting the jump in the game. And that shouldn&#8217;t happen in the newspaper. You&#8217;re a newspaper reporter, not a developer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>and a Mayor who follows (not surprisingly) with:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get into specific dates and specific projects with you guys because I know what you do with that: You come back later and you talk about the things that we haven&#8217;t done.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>don&#8217;t sound like executors of a &#8220;people&#8217;s plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for that matter, I haven&#8217;t yet found a comprehensive list of who is serving on the Parishwide Recovery Committee, or when and where their future meetings will be held (I would think their proceedings would fall under the requirements of Louisiana&#8217;s Open Meetings Law). Also, Blakely has called the UNOP <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-20/1173338817274060.xml&#38;coll=1&#38;thispage=2">&#8220;a critical part of [the] process&#8221;</a> (falling somewhat short of explicitly endorsing it &#8211; and while we&#8217;re on that topic, is the Parishwide Recovery <em>Committee</em> the same as the Parishwide Recovery <em>Council</em>, or is it a pointed snub? I&#8217;ve seen it referred to as both), and he seems to invoke it as the basis of calling it &#8220;the people&#8217;s plan,&#8221; but if the UNOP and/or other previous planning efforts are going to be the sum-total of public participation, I&#8217;m concerned. Not that I think we need to be put through any more magic-marker-and-red-dot exercises, but the UNOP has its share of woolly bits that could be stretched to fit plenty of interpretations of &#8220;the will of the people.&#8221; The public deserves comment periods and scrutiny of plan particulars in the media, mainstream- and citizen-varieties. Any developers worth their salt should be able to cope with that.</p>
<p>So, my fingers are crossed that we can get some positive action without more secrecy, otherwise, I&#8217;m afraid New Orleans Recovery = CRoWN EVERYONE A LOSER (OK, I cheated on that one &#8211; it was just too close to resist).</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been in a bit of a blogging funk lately. It feels like beating a dead horse sometimes, and my flogging arm is getting worn out. If only you could mechanize it some way&#8230; But wait, you can if you have <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1164957505166850.xml&#38;coll=1&#38;thispage=3">2.4 million dollars</a>, and you can beat it from five different cities simultaneously! Yes, I let morbid curiosity overcome me again, and I attended UNOP/AmericaSpeaks&#8217; Community Congress II last Saturday.</p>
<p>I have to give them some credit &#8211; this Congress came much closer to pre-Katrina demographics where race and income were concerned, although not on age or planning district residence. This Congress was rather more participatory than the last one as well. Rather than voting exclusively on pre-ordained options, the <a href="http://www.americaspeaks.org/library/town_meeting.pdf">&#8220;Theme Team&#8221;</a> synthesized alternative scenarios besides the ones presented by UNOP based on the submissions of each table. It&#8217;s a good thing, too, because &#8220;scenario&#8221; is a strong word for what the original options were on each of the six topics. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Roads, Transit and Utilities</strong></p>
<li>Spread available funds evenly throughout the city.</li>
<li>Concentrate available recovery funds in areas of the city with the greatest need*</li>
<li>Raise additional funds, possibly through higher taxes or user fees, so that all infrastructure can be repaired and improved.</li>
<ul>
<li>(note: &#8220;greatest need&#8221; wasn&#8217;t explicitly defined, but from the pros and cons section of the handout, it was clear that UNOP equates greatest need with greatest population, not level of damage)</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More (but not all) of the scenarios and alternatives can be seen in the <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.com/uploads/UNOPpreliminaryreportdraftv4-01856.pdf">Preliminary Report</a>.</p>
<p>Someone remind me again &#8211; how many months of planning has it taken to come up with these &#8220;scenarios&#8221;? I thought at first that this sort of narrowing the scope &#8211; from extremely vague to somewhat vague &#8211; via citizen input might have been a good thing to have done back in July or August. The sort of information produced strikes me as where to <em>start</em> planning, not refine it. But then I got sticker shock:</p>
<blockquote><li>6 topics</li>
<li>approximately 2,500 participants</li>
<li>$2.4 million (for just this session)</li>
</blockquote>
<p>At $400,000 per topic and roughly $960 per participant, what do New Orleanians really gain that&#8217;s of lasting value? Is that really all the public input we can buy for $2.4 million? I hope the funders are watching.</p>

			<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although the Roman empire expanded to a great territory, the Roman republicans were never concerned about the actuality of political participation by citizens living far away from Rome, where the assembly met regularly. In fact, most citizens of the Roman empire probably never attended an assembly, and the situation created a random and skewed system of representation &#8211; those living close to Rome became de facto &#8220;representatives&#8221; of other citizens of the Roman empire.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.oycf.org/Perspectives/3_123199/representative_government.htm">Representative Government and Democracy</a>, Bo Li</p></blockquote>
<p>With all the invocation of Democracy and the Founding Fathers in this latest planning process, one thing that seems to have been forgotten is the role of representation. With all of our actual elected representatives snubbing the UNOP, it&#8217;s more and more doubtful how much backbone the UNOP will have as a &#8220;Unified New Orleans Plan,&#8221; but it&#8217;s far from certain yet whether or how much the Lambert plans or any others will bear much fruit with respect to funding and implementation either. Whatever the fate of the UNOP, it&#8217;s worth drawing some lessons from its latest venture, especially with regard to what passes for public participation, for posterity if nothing else. The first lesson, I think, is well illustrated by the quote about Roman government above: those living close to New Orleans are <em>not</em> adequate &#8220;representatives&#8221; of citizens in the uninhabitable or barely inhabitable portions of our city, however well-intentioned (or not). Public hearings, meetings, and comment periods are indispensable to democratic government, but they&#8217;re never a substitute for proportional representation. (For a thoughtful, multi-faceted review of public partipication, the lack of it, what&#8217;s passed for it, and responses to it in post-Katrina New Orleans &#8211; from the BNOB to UNOP&#8217;s Community Congress &#8211; it&#8217;s definitely worth reading People Get Ready&#8217;s <a href="http://peoplegetready.blogspot.com/2006/10/we-have-more-than-that-at-400-mass-on.html">We have more than that at the 4:00 mass on Saturday</a> post.)</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially times like ours, the representation allowed for by our constitutions and charters &#8211; the mayors, city councils, governors, senators, representatives and presidents &#8211; aren&#8217;t enough; legislation doesn&#8217;t conveniently exist for the level of public involvement required for a whole region&#8217;s reconstruction. The first step is, of course, actively seeking population samples that reflect the real make-up of the city, not just waiting for who happens to show up. In an era when government models itself so much on business, is it too much to ask that we call the marketing department to see how they survey any and all demographics they want to target? It&#8217;s a challenge, to say the least, in the post-Katrina diaspora, but not one that can&#8217;t have its margin of error significantly reduced. There&#8217;s a name for the sort of &#8220;public participation&#8221; we&#8217;ve been treated to so far: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_poll">Voodoo Poll</a>. How apt.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The most common examples of voodoo polls are those which ask for people to phone a number, or to click a voting option on a website, or send back a coupon cut from a newspaper. &#8230; The most glaring difference between a voodoo poll and a legitimate poll is that voodoo polls have self-selecting samples&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But even if we had proportional representation of New Orleans&#8217; citizenry, it&#8217;s still all for naught if the questions don&#8217;t represent the real issues. Plenty of poll-watchers caution that attention to the wording of poll questions is imperative in interpreting their results. You don&#8217;t have to be a bought-out push poller to ask questions that are meaningless, or worse, misleading. This is an area that&#8217;s not new ground either. Here&#8217;s one of the best articulations I&#8217;ve seen of how to approach developing meaningful survey questions, and why it matters:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Good practice in survey research includes framing the questions in a way that people can recognize their own point of view in the alternatives that they are given by the interviewer. Polling is, after all, the art of putting words into peoples&#8217; mouths. Objective practice demands that the words chosen for the questionnaire come close to the words that advocates of each point of view would use if they were given the chance to frame their opinion without prompting. In scientific or academic surveys, the phrasing of questions is usually drawn from published remarks by leaders of one point of view or another or from &#8220;focus groups&#8221; in which ordinary citizens are asked to discuss important issues in their own terms. At SRC [Survey Research Center] we supplement these practices by &#8220;pretesting&#8221; questions in practice interviews. If the respondents to practice interviews have a hard time recognizing their point of view in the questions, then we rewrite them. We try not to have more than one respondent in 20 say they &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; how they feel on an issue unless we feel that the issue itself is so obscure that many people really have no opinion. With a widely discussed issue, a scientific poll should not have more than five percent of answers be &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; (Converse and Presser 1989).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Advocacy polls, on the other hand, frequently &#8220;slant&#8221; questions by raising questions in a way that are favorable to one point of view in a debate-<del>and unfavorable to another</del>-or by posing questions that create a dilemma for proponents of one side (Asher 1990). This practice makes it difficult for persons from one persuasion to answer the questions as stated. They are typically in a quandary because they cannot fully agree with any of the statements offered them, or they cannot choose between the alternatives that are posed because they agree with both or disagree with both. Some poll respondents then refuse to answer the question or say they don&#8217;t know which alternative to choose. Others say &#8220;both?&#8217; or &#8220;neither&#8221; as their reply.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://aad.english.ucsb.edu/docs/hout.report.html">Wording, Polling, and Opinion</a>, Michael Hout</p></blockquote>
<p>Any group that has the capacity to convene Town Hall-style meetings of citizens and collect their input should perhaps be less concerned with determining citizens&#8217; answers to policy questions than with determining the real questions for which various citizens&#8217; groups have already proposed answers. We can stop asking what New Orleanians&#8217; generalized Hopes and Concerns or Needs and Goals are about recovery, and start asking what are the controversies about <em>how</em> to address them, because the options are well-considered and have been articulated by plenty.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m not sure why I keep attending <a href="www.unifiedneworleansplan.com">UNOP</a> events. I guess I just feel compelled to see what they&#8217;re going to pull next &#8211; it&#8217;s certainly not from a sense that I&#8217;m &#8220;participating;&#8221; there&#8217;s only so much use that can come of asking people to rank their nebulous Needs and Goals (or Hopes and Concerns as was the case yesterday), and only so many times it&#8217;s worth asking. For the record, UNOP, I think crime is bad, flood protection is good, and some affordable housing, schools and hospitals would be rather nice too, if I&#8217;m allowed to have that many preferences. So I attended yesterday morning&#8217;s Community Congress #1 at the Convention Center&#8217;s <em>La Nouvelle Orleans Ballroom</em>, where I was treated to presentations on some of the citywide data that&#8217;s been collected and analysed to date, and to the first instance of <a href="www.americaspeaks.org">AmericaSpeaks&#8217;</a> involvement in feedback collection.</p>
<p>Hearing some infrastructure, housing, health care, etc statistics was of some interest &#8211; not least because it&#8217;s the first substantive product made public from the citywide component of the plan. As someone mentioned at the last <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/section/22-70/">CSO</a> meeting, it would have been nice if they&#8217;d posted all or some of it for citizens to view and digest before being asked to provide feedback on it, but they promise it <em>will</em> go on The Website (for posterity, apparently). Wait and see&#8230;</p>
<p>The debut of AmericaSpeaks, the organization &#8220;brought in to support the New Orleans planning effort because of concerns that many displaced New Orleanians, especially low-income African-Americans, have no voice in recovery decisions&#8221; and to collect data and citizen feedback, was of some interest as well. I hope they have some fancier tricks up their 21st century sleeves for putting the <a href="http://www.nola.com/printer/printer.ssf?/base/news-6/1160641779246500.xml">$3 million</a> they expect their endeavor to cost ($2.3 million already committed by mysterious private foundations they decline to identify) to use in future meetings &#8211; one of the first things they demonstrated to the ballroom using their wireless, real-time polling gizmos was that we were decidedly not consistent with the pre-Katrina demographics in race, income, geography or age (curiously, they made a specialpoint of emphasizing that the 15-19 year old age group was dramatically underrepresented, and we should take care to consider their interests &#8211; under-14 year olds apparently need not worry). What they intend to do to address the imbalance isn&#8217;t quite clear to me. They did note that the Congress would be broadcast on cable access channels in the &#8220;diaspora cities&#8221; and that viewers there would be able to provide their feedback via the UNOP&#8217;s toll-free number, but the staffer who answered when I called hadn&#8217;t heard anything about that yet.</p>
<p>Maybe the real outreach component of AmericaSpeaks&#8217; program hasn&#8217;t begun in earnest &#8211; most of the press surrounding AmericaSpeaks&#8217; involvement revolves around the ultimate December 2 Community Congress, so it&#8217;s not impossible. I think it would be of enormous benefit to New Orleans to work with an organization that&#8217;s capable of locating enough respondents, both here in town and elsewhere, to make up something approaching a representative statistical sampling of pre-Katrina residents and to gather their feelings on how our recovery should go. Unfortunately, not only is it unclear how displaced residents will be reached, the UNOP is losing the audience it&#8217;s already had. Among the ways in which an AmericaSpeaks <a href="http://www.americaspeaks.org/services/town_meetings/what_is.htm">21st Century Town Meeting</a> (registered trademark) is supposed to be superior to the old-fashioned public hearing is that the public hearing &#8220;primarily engages the &#8216;usual suspects&#8217; &#8211; citizens already civically active on specific issues,&#8221; and yet there we were, the usual self-selected suspects, diligently reporting to be put through our paces. And that group is rapidly de-selecting &#8211; I see fewer and fewer of the faces I know to still be active in their own neighborhoods and in general recovery-related activities. I guess even morbid curiosity wears out after a while.</p>
<p>How to accurately sample a population of which more than half is displaced may be one of the many stretches of uncharted territory New Orleans is faced with right now, but how to compose survey questions to elicit worthwhile, unambiguous answers isn&#8217;t. Polling is a pretty well-developed industry. The Usual Suspects may provide an incomplete data set, but they&#8217;re by and large an earnest bunch, who give recovery matters a lot of thought, and their responses as individuals count as much as anyone else&#8217;s. So what was made of their sacrifice of three hours of a beautiful Saturday morning? Not much, as far as I could tell. I&#8217;m not sure how the questions were crafted &#8211; I&#8217;m sure UNOP told the AmericaSpeaks people what they wanted to ask, but my impression of how AmericaSpeaks conducted the polling suggested that they were more involved than mere readers and tabulators, and anyway, I&#8217;d expect an organization that purports to specialize in citizen-led contribution to decision-making to have some expertise how best to craft that opportunity to contribute. A lot of the questions were of the no-brainer variety: it won&#8217;t come as much surprise that I&#8217;m not the only New Orleanian who thinks hospitals are important. And when issues aren&#8217;t so trivial, it isn&#8217;t so trivial to design a statement so it can be rated on a 1 to 5 scale &#8211; but it isn&#8217;t rocket science either. Anyone who&#8217;s ever had to answer &#8220;on a scale of 1 to 5&#8230;&#8221; (which is just about everyone) has run across the dilemma conditional situations. It may not be possible to eliminate that entirely, but you can go a long way with a little common sense. I wish I&#8217;d saved the 5 page paper questionnaire we were asked to complete, or better yet, just not turned mine in for all the good it&#8217;ll do, so I could quote some of the howlers verbatim &#8211; one example off the top of my head:</p>
<blockquote><p>On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 equalling &#8220;reason to return to New Orleans&#8221; and 5 equalling &#8220;reason not to return,&#8221; rate the following: adequate levee protection.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does that mean I&#8217;ve returned because I think the levee protection is adequate, or does that mean I <em>would</em> return <em>if</em> it were? After presentations that included current and projected levee status, which is allegedly back up to its pre-Katrina level and undergoing further improvements, I really don&#8217;t know which to assume. It didn&#8217;t get any better on the rest of the pages.</p>
<p>Also eyebrow raising were a couple instances when AmericaSpeaks president Carolyn Lukensmeyer prefaced questions with admonitions of what to consider while voting. In one case involving funding for parks and recreation areas, she told us to remember the presentation we just heard, and how important it was For The Children (who were probably out enjoying parks and recreation areas rather than sitting in a dark ballroom pretending to be a market-research focus group). If you&#8217;d like to capture the true Voice of the People, AmericaSpeaks, you&#8217;ll do well to let us remember what to consider on our own. In another case, regarding whether it&#8217;s important or not for New Orleans to be the most populous city in the state, Ms. Lukensmeyer brought up Galveston and Houston, raising the specter of becoming a tiny, boutique tourist town while all the real industry moves upriver. Although that happens to be a concern of mine, I don&#8217;t think it was AmericaSpeaks&#8217; position to frame the issue in a way that steered attention to an all-or-nothing sort of view while there&#8217;s still legitimate room for debate about a smaller, but still vital city. It really isn&#8217;t their position to remind us of <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m left with the bitter feeling that this is just another UNOP photo-op &#8211; the citizenry raptly attentive to the big screen with their very own thoughts and feelings reflected back to them: how <em>democratic</em> (at one point the Founding Fathers were even invoked). And this time they&#8217;ve literally <a href="http://thinknola.com/blog/think/2006/08/04/outsourcing-democracy/">outsourced</a> it.</p>
<p>The Ballroom has spoken.</p>

			<h3>October 14th, 2006</h3>

			<p>I just got back from the <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/districts/2/">District 2</a> Needs &#38; Goals <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/districts/2/meetings/58/">kick-off</a> meeting with H3 Studio. A few quick thoughts:</p>
<p>Their slide presentation suggested that they&#8217;ve already compiled a lot of information about the district, its neighborhood groups (besides the &#8220;official&#8221; eight city-defined neighborhoods they&#8217;ve identified 28 actual functioning groups), and plans for particular areas that are already in existence, both pre- and post-Katrina. H3 principal John Hoal indicated several times that this information would be on &#8220;the website,&#8221; which, when I asked about it later, proved to be the <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com">UNOP</a> site. No luck with that yet, unless it&#8217;s squirreled away somewhere pretty clever. The too predictable <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/districts/2/deliverables/">Deliverables &#38; Support Documents</a> page is still &#8220;coming soon&#8221; as of this post. Too bad, because it really does look like they&#8217;ve been doing they&#8217;re homework, including walking every foot of sidewalk and driving every street in the district. The maps they produced for their slideshow, of the varying conditions of streets, sidewalks, housing, etc would be great resources. <a href="http://www.h3studio.com/">H3&#8242;s own website</a> was, sadly, one of those Flash affairs (I had to download an upgrade just to see it at all) that amounts to nothing more than a set of incredibly fancy lists. There are some teasers of maps and renderings that show up when you hover over the lists, but no links to close-ups, at least not in Firefox. It&#8217;s also completely unsearchable.  It&#8217;s frustrating to see such an incredible potential information source so overdesigned and &#8211; I was going to say underutilized &#8211; but it&#8217;s really flat-out unutilized.</p>
<p>It was good to see key members of the <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/districts/2/deliverables/">planning team</a> in attendence and leading the proceedings, including John Hoal, Derek Hoeferlin and Laura Lyon. Besides the slide presentation on the course of the UNOP meetings to come and on the research H3 et al have done to date, the rest of the session was devoted to small groups reviewing the Needs, Vision and Goals already collected by H3, and then selecting their top three concerns from those listed or their own devising. There was a lot of consensus when the small groups reported back &#8211; I guess we&#8217;re not a very contentious lot around here, fortunately. Crime, schools, decent affordable housing in historically appropriate styles (rehabilitated historic homes wherever possible), community health care, and closing the above/below St. Charles divide were big hits, but the applause-winning show-stopper was actual enforcement of existing zoning. All valid and interesting enough, but a bit on the woolly side &#8211; who&#8217;s pro-crime or anti-education? The devil is in the details, after all (hence, I think, the support for enforcing zoning), and we&#8217;re still a long way from knowing how and when those will be developed and implemented.</p>

			<h3>September 6th, 2006</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>Katrina made New Orleans one enormous laboratory, which didn&#8217;t end with dumping the science projects growing in the fridge. We&#8217;re about to be one of the biggest things to ever happen to Urban Planning (and all the social theory that goes with it), we are, as far as I know, the first city in the U.S. to switch to a primarily charter public school system, the flood gates and levee repairs are the biggest nail-biter to date in the 21st century, and then there&#8217;s the over-arching test of whether and how we&#8217;ll survive at all (which plenty of latter-day Know Nothings are anxiously waiting for us to fail).</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the nonprofits. Last November, Pablo Eisenberg wrote about the <a href="http://www.icnl.org/knowledge/ijnl/vol8iss1/art_4.htm">future of the nonprofit world</a> in <a href="http://www.icnl.org">International Center for Nonprofit Law</a>&#8216;s journal, which <a href="http://northwestcarrollton.com">Karen at NorthwestCarrollton.com</a> brought to my attention. There seems no better place or time to examine the ramifications of his questions &#8220;in the field,&#8221; than here in New Orleans, where every org worth its charter is involved one way or another, and when private money with a public mission is so critical at every level.</p>
<p>Eisenberg&#8217;s first matter of cocern for the future of nonprofits is hardly a new one. It seems there can&#8217;t be too much policing against fraud &#8212; something we do well to remember in these parts, where some people <a href="http://gbitch.blogspot.com/2006/07/all-need-to-fall-down-new-orleans-city.html">can&#8217;t seem to keep their hands off of donated Durangos</a>. He goes on to detail other threats to the integrity of the sector, like conflicts of interest and increasing commercialization, but less obvious and more interesting to me is his call for all nonprofits in general, but foundations in particular, to promote democratic institutions and practices. By this he doesn&#8217;t seem to mean that cancer foundations or Save the Chinchilla drives, say, should quit funding medical research or chinchilla rescue and launch voter registration drives instead, but he claims that:</p>
<blockquote><p>from its earliest days, a primary mission of the nonprofit sector has been the preservation and strengthening of American democracy. This role has taken many forms: protecting civil liberties and individual rights; leveling the playing field for all citizens; building strong democratic institutions; providing a social safety net for the neediest members of society; and assuring a competitive free-enterprise system.</p></blockquote>
<p>An interesting assertion because, while I guess I&#8217;ve always assumed that nonprofithood should entail some self-sacrificial greater good, I&#8217;ve never seen it taken to that level of abstraction and articulated that way. I don&#8217;t know if I would have concluded myself that there&#8217;s a democratic obligation on the part of foundations and charities, but now I have a hard time saying why that shouldn&#8217;t be the case. Between tax-exemption and a stated mission to pursue, a fund or funder yields a certain control to the issue itself, whatever it may be &#8212; even if it&#8217;s Save the Chinchillas, just what constitutes the Good of Chinchillas is not entirely up to you to decide once you get 501<code>(c)(3)</code> status for it.</p>
<p>Eisenberg goes on to point out that the combination of our eroding social safety nets and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor have simultaneously made philanthropy more necessary and more concentrated in fewer hands:</p>
<blockquote><p>The enormous expansion of foundation assets in recent years has added to the inequities in American life. As public support for social programs, job training, affordable housing, and projects to feed the poor and temporarily house the homeless have been reduced, the burden for such responsibilities has increasingly fallen on private individual and institutional philanthropy. Public responsibilities are becoming a matter of private charity. An elite, growing, and unrepresentative group of private foundations are now making decisions about the allocation of funds for social welfare. In a sense, &#8220;noblesse oblige&#8221; is slowly taking over what should be public decision-making.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Far from leveling the playing field, civil society appears to have acquiesced or, at worst, abetted a national policy that has slowly made it more difficult for many citizens to enjoy equal opportunities and, at the same time, made it easier for wealthy citizens to assert greater control over society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noblesse oblige is not what I want to rebuild New Orleans on. As luck would have it, shortly before reading this article, I was talking to my brother, Ben, whose reading list is always worth checking out. It turns out Ben is in the middle of Robert Caro&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker">The Power Broker</a>, about Robert Moses an &#8220;idealistic advocate for Progressive reform&#8221; who went on to become more powerful than mayors and governors of New York, largely via sitting (unelected) on boards and committees. I haven&#8217;t received the copy I ordered yet, but from what I understand, Moses&#8217; noblesse oblige was not much appreciated by the end (even around here: as an advocate for cars and freeways over public transportation, he happens to be the guy who proposed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieux_Carre_Expressway">Vieux Carre Riverfront Expressway</a>, giving us the Second Battle of New Orleans).</p>
<p>One of the most interesting responses to Eisenberg is <a href="http://www.icnl.org/knowledge/ijnl/vol8iss1/art_4r2.htm">H. Peter Karoff&#8217;s</a>. He ethusiastically takes up the call for greater transparency and public accountibility in nonprofit workings, lambasting paternalistic attitudes among some foundation trustees:</p>
<blockquote><p>Major foundations more often than not have viewed themselves as the source of innovation, &#8220;the manufacturer,&#8221; with little if any input from recipient organizations and communities, &#8220;the users.&#8221; Strategic and Venture Philanthropists likewise often view themselves as crucial to innovation. It is assumed that the nonprofit organization recipients and programs will not, cannot, perform without them. Nonprofit organizations, which are often intermediaries between funders and communities being served, are sometimes guilty of the same patronizing assumptions about constituencies and clients.</p></blockquote>
<p>Karoff points to the Internet and Open Source software development as the torchbearers of the new Democracy, and the exemplars for future nonprofit management. It&#8217;s an admirable and popular sentiment, praising the organization of the Internet and proposing it as a model, but I&#8217;m not sure it always means very much without a closer examination of what sorts of collaboration take off and why, and whether the problem being proposed for solution Internet-style lends itself to such a strategy and how. What does it get the chinchillas? And what does it mean for the GNOF, the NOCSF, the LRA Fund, etc.?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know, but I think a large part of the answer comes from the <a href="http://northwestcarrollton.com/2006/09/01/zealous-nuts/">zealous nut</a> phenomenon (thanks to Karen again). To add a little to what Karen has already excerpted on her site from the <a href="http://www.pps.org/info/bulletin/zealous_nuts">Project for Public Spaces article</a> on the passionate amateurs who are deeply engaged in the upkeep and development of their own communities:</p>
<blockquote><p>More and more developers, designers and leaders are now realizing that the success of a public project depends on the participation of the public itself. That seems obvious, but it took a long time for many decision makers to figure that out.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to note that foundations in some places (like the <a href="http://www.ruthmottfoundation.org">Ruth Mott Foundation</a> in Flint, Michigan) are starting to shift their focus toward the crazy neighborhood ladies (and gentlemen) when it comes to civic improvement.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, it should be interesting to watch the numerous funds and organizations at work here, local, national and international, and their degrees of responsiveness to the public they aim to serve. This debate takes on so much more urgency when actual public policy is being determined by foundations (no offence to the chinchillas). I see some interest in &#8220;public input&#8221; on the part of the UNOP and its funders, but it&#8217;s not quite the same as the kind of democratic responsiveness and public involvement I see in the Eisenberg PPS articles, not yet anyway. How the planning teams themselves relate to their assigned districts will be the test, I suppose.</p>

			<p>Reading Karen&#8217;s <a href="http://northwestcarrollton.com/2006/08/10/who-elected-the-lra/">Who Elected the LRA?</a> post and following its links today, I was surprised to find out (where have I been?) that just as the <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com">UNOP</a> is supposed to be administered by the CSO, which is overseen by the NOCSF, which was in turn established by the <a href="www.gnof.org">GNOF</a> to manage $4.5 million in grants to create a planning process (<a href="http://thinknola.com/wiki/Recovery_Acronyms">acronym and abbreviation help</a>); the information-gathering and planning of <a href="http://www.lra.louisiana.gov/">LRA</a>&#8216;s long-term recovery planning initiative, &#8220;<a href="http://www.louisianaspeaks.org/">Louisiana Speaks</a>,&#8221; is being funded significantly by the <a href="http://www.braf.org/newsarticle.cfm?articleid=101439&#38;PTSidebarOptID=15113&#38;returnTo=index.cfm&#38;returntoname=Home&#38;SiteID=1582&#38;pageid=10175&#38;sidepageid=10175&#38;thetitle=The%20LRA%20Fund&#38;banner1img=banner_1H.JPG&#38;banner2img=banner_2H.JPG&#38;bannerbg=banner_bg_h.gif&#38;siteURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ebraf%2Eorg">LRA Fund</a>, which was established by the <a href="http://www.braf.org/">Baton Rouge Area Foundation</a> (BRAF), and will be administered by the <a href="http:lrasupportfoundation.org">LRA Support Foundation</a> (created separately from the LRA Fund) once it gets its IRS qualification as a charity. (Gasp. I wish I had a <a href="https://toulousestreet.wordpress.com/2006/07/25/the-recovery-process-explained/">flowchart</a>) For now, as far as I can tell, the LRA Fund Committee is holding the purse-strings.</p>
<p>I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised, really. A plan is required to release federal relief funding, but little or no funding is given to the creation of a detailed and comprehensive plan. The city/state/parish is left with no alternative but to look to private donors.</p>
<p>What really surprises me (and maybe this shouldn&#8217;t either) is that at the bottom of its home page, the LRASF site declares: &#8220;The LRA Fund Committee has voluntarily decided to act in a manner consistent with the spirit of Louisiana Open Meetings Laws.&#8221; Kudos to the LRAFC for choosing to be open. I mean that. What concerns me though, is that a private organization that holds the linchpin to the disbursement of billions in public funds (and we&#8217;ve been seeing how much the planning of the plan can matter with the UNOP) <em>could chose not to</em>. To be fair, Blanco&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gov.state.la.us/assets/docs/Executive_Orders/LouisianaRecoveryAuthority_exec_order.pdf">executive order</a> establishing the LRA requires &#8220;a mechanism for public input and modifications based on such input,&#8221; but the UNOP&#8217;s &#8220;mechanisms for public input&#8221; to date have shown how little and dry a bone the public can be thrown.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to suggest at all that private foundations with influence on public spending are all necessarily nefarious evil-doers intent on selling the public lock, stock and barrel to their cronies. But they&#8217;re not necessarily saints either, any more than politicians are. Our democracy doesn&#8217;t survive by the vote alone; it&#8217;s founded on checks and balances and public accountability because it&#8217;s just plain bad policy to expect people, even good people, to deny their personal interests for the sake of public interest. Whether it&#8217;s willful corruption or the slippery slope of &#8220;I have a buddy whose company can do that,&#8221; it&#8217;s just too easy to drift away from the job you&#8217;re entrusted to do when no one is watching how you do it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an awful lot of responsibility without much obligation I can see that&#8217;s not self-imposed. We can hope that personal integrity and/or PR help keep things relatively open (or at least &#8220;consistent with the spirit of openness&#8221;), but I&#8217;m a bit shocked that it would be legal not to.</p>

			<p>The release of billions in federal funding for the recovery of New Orleans depends on the acceptance of a single, unified plan, covering everything from individual neighborhoods&#8217; redevelopment to city-wide infrastructure. One feature of a such a unified plan must be meaningful public participation in the process, accommodating the city&#8217;s diverse citizenry and interests. Without extensive public representation, it is almost inconceivable that a plan would receive the endorsement necessary to begin disbursement of funds, in fact two prior planning attempts, the Mayor&#8217;s Bring New Orleans Back Commission, and the City Council&#8217;s Lambert-Danzey plan, failed in part because of inaccessibility to the public.</p>
<p>When the announcement was made that the Greater New Orleans Foundation (GNOF), its fiduciary committee, the New Orleans Community Support Foundation (NOCSF), City Council, the Mayor, and the Louisiana Recovery Authority (LRA) had come to an agreement to support the NOCSF&#8217;s Unified New Orleans Plan (UNOP), Governor Blanco responded, &#8220;This process will be democratic and inclusive. Folks who live in the neighborhood will be integrally involved.&#8221; Mayor Nagin called the plan &#8220;democracy in action&#8221; in his own press release on the announcement. Democracy in invoked repeatedly in descriptions and discussions of the Unified New Orleans Plan, and the test of its legitimacy rests above all in the consequential inclusion of citizens. To date, there has been minimal opportunity for substantive public involvement&#8211;attendees at a July 30 meeting gave their recommendations for redrawing official neighborhood boundaries, and made their requests for the number of planners and project areas they would like their Planning Districts to have, but these decisions were limited to those in attendance. The selection of preferred neighborhood and district Planning Teams will be the first occasion for a public vote in the UNOP process. The integrity of this voting procedure, therefore, reflects on the integrity of the entire UNOP as a democratic entity and on any of its actions to follow.</p>
<p>Despite less than a weeks&#8217; notice, hundreds managed to attend the two public meetings and neighborhood groups and individuals all over the city are earnestly studying the 15 planning groups and what they have to offer. Many of the hardest-hit neighborhoods have already been working with planners for months &#8212; some with the Lambert-Danzey team and some with firms they hired themselves in the hope that when funding did come, they would be reimbursed. The Louisiana Recovery Authority will be administering the federal funds earmarked for New Orleans. With its endorsement of the UNOP and the requirement that UNOP planning teams submit neighborhood/district plans, many fear that months of work will go unfunded and come undone. Having a vote in their teams&#8217; selection process is taken in deadly earnest by thousands of New Orleanians.</p>

			<p>I posted my <a href="http://beckyhoutman.com/2006/07/30/unified-new-orleans-plan-my-take-so-far-on-11-months-of-development/">Unified New Orleans Plan</a> on the <a href="http://thinknola.com/wiki/Unified_New_Orleans_Plan">New Orleans Wiki</a> tonight, edited a bit, and with a little more on what&#8217;s been happening since. The meeting descriptions could stand some fleshing out, especially since I played hooky on Tuesday to attend a couple Night Out Against Crime events in my area: the <a href="http://adrastos.blog-city.com/picture_time_night_out_on_napoleon.htm">Bouligny Riverside-Faubourg Marengo-Faubourg Delachaise Triumvirate</a>, and my own hood, <a href="http://tourobouligny.com/2006/07/05/touro-bouligny-neighborhood-block-party/">Touro Bouligny</a>. I&#8217;m pleased to say that there were no long lines to get in, I didn&#8217;t have to put a red dot on anything, and the noise level was quite pleasant.</p>
<p>Anyway, if anyone has an corrections to make or anything to add to the wiki article as the process stumbles along, more editors would be much appreciated (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page">wiki markup instructions</a> if you&#8217;ve never done it before).

			<p>From the <a href="http://www.gnof.org/images/Frequently_Asked_Questions_7-5.pdf">NOCF&#8217;s FAQ page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Membership on the Community Support Organization is comprised of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>One person appointed by the Mayor of New Orleans</li>
<li>One person appointed by the New Orleans City Council</li>
<li>One person appointed by the City Planning Commission</li>
<li>One person appointed by the Greater New Orleans Foundation</li>
<li>Five people selected from nominations submitted by individual neighborhood organizations</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1, 1, 1, 1, and 5 makes 9, right?</p>
<p>From <a href="http://neighborhoodsplanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/Neighborhood%20Nomination%20Form.pdf">The New Orleans Community Support Foundation Nomination Form for Neighborhood Representatives for the Community Support Organization</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The structure of the Community Support Organization Support Foundation will be comprised of one representative each from the Mayor&#8217;s Office, the New Orleans City Council, the City Planning Commission, the Greater New Orleans Foundation and two representatives of city-wide non-governmental organizations that are working to support the neighborhood planning process and five people selected from nominations submitted by neighborhood organizations.</p></blockquote>
<p>1, 1, 1, 1, 2, and 5 makes 11, doesn&#8217;t it? Or is the lack of a comma supposed to indicate that the GNOF <em>and</em> two reps of city-wide NGOs get one representative in common? Why aren&#8217;t these NGOs named, whether they get a whole rep apiece, or just a third? Maybe they don&#8217;t matter &#8211; everywhere else I&#8217;ve seen references to the CSO board make-up it&#8217;s been 9 members.</p>
<p>Still elsewhere, the <a href="http://www.nola.com/newslogs/breaking/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_localbreakingnews/archives/2006_07_05.html">Times Pic</a> announces:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Community Support Organization (CSO), a nine-member advisory committee, will oversee and monitor the planning efforts. The nine members of the Community Support Organization, still to be named, will include one representative appointed by Mayor Nagin, one by the City Council, one by the City Planning Commission, one by the Greater New Orleans Foundation, <em>and five citizens selected from the five council districts</em>. (emphasis mine)</p></blockquote>
<p>Like wise, <a href="http://www.cityofno.com/portal.aspx?portal=1&#38;load=~/PortalModules/ViewPressRelease.ascx&#38;itemid=3637">a press release from the Mayor&#8217;s Office</a>.</p>
<p>But what really concerns me isn&#8217;t so much the rampant ambiguity of number or identity, it&#8217;s the question of <em>who approves</em> the mysterious 9.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.com/home/section/6/">UNOP&#8217;s FAQs:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>23) Will the mayor and city council members have to agree with the people selected to serve on the Community Support Organization?</em><br />
Appointments to Community Support Organization will be vetted by both the Mayor and City Council, but appointments will be made by the New Orleans Community Support Foundation board.</p></blockquote>
<p>And from the <a href="http://neighborhoodsplanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/Neighborhood%20Nomination%20Form.pdf">nomination form</a> again: &#8220;Please return this form by fax at 504-569-1820, by email to<br />
neworleansrfq@concordia.com or mail to NOCSF, 201 St. Charles Ave, Suite<br />
4314, New Orleans, LA 70170.&#8221; (Who&#8217;s guarding the hen-house exactly?)</p>
<p>So the private non-profit, <a href="http://www.gnof.org">GNOF</a>, and the NOCSF <em>which</em> it <em>composed</em> will get final approval of <em>6 of the 9 seats</em> (or 8 of 11) of the group that is going to monitor, advise, evaluate, coordinate, support, oversee, select, recommend, implement, etc., etc. everything to do with the UNOP? We two members selected by actual elected officials and one selected by a city department, and all the rest owe their position to a private group?</p>
<p>The GNOF may be saints (although I fear they&#8217;re not), and the City Council may not be either (what city&#8217;s are). But we <em>elect</em> our Council members to <em>represent</em> us &#8211; i.e. to make exactly these sorts of decisions. The Council is obligated at the very least to operate in the public view, private groups do so at their convenience. It makes me wary to say the least that several of the lists of the CSO&#8217;s composition make reference to the five Council Districts, as if to imply that the Council has something to do with the selection of more than one representative. <strong>This process is not democratic in any way, shape or form</strong>, and democracy is way messier than Steve Bingler thinks&#8211;what alarms me is everything that looks a little too tidy about this process.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing. If you look once more at the <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.com/home/section/6/">UNOP&#8217;s FAQs</a>, there are several things that the CSO is already supposed to have done, such as approve the list of planners we were presented with after the RFQs were in, and &#8220;then work with neighborhood leaders to determine which of the pre-qualified Neighborhood Planning Teams would work best with each neighborhoodâ€™s constituents.&#8221; Yet the CSO&#8217;s composition is always described in the future tense&#8230;</p>

			<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the attendant flooding and other related destruction, many parties have deemed a unified, city-wide planning process essential to the recovery of New Orleans. The release of  billions of dollars in federal recovery funds, as well as some private grants, depend on the formation of a master plan covering everything from city-wide infrastructure issues to neighborhood-specific projects. Eleven months from Katrina&#8217;s landfall, a &#8220;Unified New Orleans Plan&#8221; is just now beginning to coalesce. In a July 5, 2006 <a href="http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/press_releases/2006/no_pr070506.pdf">press release</a>, <a href="http://www.cityofno.com/Portals/Portal35/portal.aspx">Mayor C. Ray Nagin</a>, the <a href="http://www.neworleanscitycouncil.com">New Orleans City Council</a> and the <a href="http://www.lra.louisiana.gov">Louisiana Recovery Authority</a> (LRA) announced their agreement to adopt a common plan, to be overseen by the <a href="http://www.gnof.org">Greater New Orleans Foundation</a>&#8216;s (GNOF) New Orleans Community Support Foundation (NOCSF).</p>
<p>Previous to endorsing the NOCSF&#8217;s plan, both the Mayor&#8217;s Office and City Council had embarked on comprehensive planning efforts of their own. While the achievements of those efforts to date will not be discarded, to what extent they continue to be funded under the LRA and NOCSF remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In October of 2005, Mayor Nagin established the <a href="http://bringneworleansback.org/">Bring Back New Orleans Commission</a> (BNOB). BNOB engaged the Philadelphia-based firm <a href="http://www.wrtdesign.com">Wallace, Roberts &#38; Todd, LLC</a> to develop its <a href="http://www.wrtdesign.com/news/NewOrleansFrameworkPlan_WRT.pdf">action plan</a>. The BNOB plan failed to get the FEMA funding it expected, however. The LRA initially assured its support of BNOB, but subsequently endorsed the NOCSF&#8217;s plan. Wallace, Roberts &#38; Todd is not on the NOCSF&#8217;s list of their officially endorsed Neighborhood and City-Wide Infrastructure planning teams. According to <a href="http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/060510planners.asp">Architectural Record News</a>, sources close to the LRA say that it&#8217;s likely that some elements of the Wallace plan will be retained in whatever the Unified New Orleans Plan proposes.</p>
<p>When FEMA support of BNOB fell through, City Council launched its own enterprise, the <a href="http://www.nolanrp.com">New Orleans Neighborhood Rebuilding Plan</a> (NOLANRP). The Council appointed Paul Lambert (<a href="http://www.lambertadvisory.com">Lambert Advisory</a>, of Miami) and Sheila Danzey (SHEDO, of New Orleans) to manage the recovery strategies of 49 neighborhoods that sustained two or more feet of flooding.</p>
<p>The GNOF was established in 1983 as &#8220;a community foundation [...] that derives its funds from gifts provided by its citizens&#8221; <a href="http://www.gnof.org/page2531.cfm">(<em>About the Foundation</em>)</a>. On September 8, 2005, the <a href="http://www.rockfound.org">Rockefeller Foundation</a> announced a <a href="http://www.rockfound.org/Library/Rockefeller_Foundation_Commits_$3_Million_for_Housing_and_Economic_Redevelopment_in_Response_to_Hurricane_Katrina.pdf">grant</a> which would eventually total $3.5 million to the GNOF. The GNOF also contributed $1 million of its own and formed the NOCSF to serve in a fiduciary capacity, overseeing the $4.5 million and the Community Support Organization (CSO) which will administer it. The CSO board will be composed of nine members, whose identities have not been announced at the time of this writing. Of the nine members, one each will be selected by the Mayor&#8217;s Office, City Council, the GNOF and the City Planning Commission, and the remaining five are to be selected from each of the City Council districts (the open call for nominees for the district seats has been closed, and candidates are being reviewed).</p>
<p>The GNOF retained the New Orleans-based firm <a href="http://www.concordia.com">Concordia LLC</a> to create a master plan and to oversee the selection of planning teams that will assist the individual neighborhoods, the wider districts and the city-wide infrastructure efforts. Among other things, the Concordia plan calls for each of New Orleans&#8217; <a href="http://www.gnocdc.org/mapping/docs/Neighborhood.pdf">73 neighborhoods</a> to select from a pre-approved list of professional architects, urban planners and other professionals to assist in their efforts and/or endorse projects already in progress, spearheaded by the BNOB, the Lambert-Danzey group, and by the neighborhood groups themselves over the many months that no other resources were available.</p>
<p>On June 5, 2006, the NOCSF issued a <a href="http://www.gnof.org/images/New_Orleans_City-wide_RFQ.pdf">Request for Qualifications</a> for parties interested in participating in their recovery process. A panel composed of one representative of the <a href="http://www.cityofno.com/Portals/Portal52/portal.aspx">City Planning Commission</a> and four &#8220;nationally recognized planning experts</a> sifted through the 65 applicants to establish the official list endorsed for the Unified New Orleans Plan. Concordia coordinated the selection process, but was not involved as a voting member. The final list was recommended to the board on July 21, 2006:</p>

<p>On July 24, 2006, a meeting open to the public was announced by the NOCSF on <a href="http://bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=7673">BayouBuzz.com</a> and on the <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.com">Unified New Orleans Plan website</a> (but not in the Times-Picayune or other local print, internet or broadcast media), scheduled for July 30,2006. The time and location of 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM at The Pavilion of Two Sisters at City Park were posted at a later date. The agenda for the July 30 meeting is to &#8220;begin the process for community members to be involved in the selection of the technical assistance teams of professionals to support them in neighborhood, district and city-wide planning.&#8221; Although all 73 neighborhoods are to be involved, the city will be divided into 13 planning districts whose boundaries are to be determined at this meeting. In addition, the criteria for working with the planning teams to be selected are to be established. On August 1, 2006 community members will have the opportunity to view presentations by the NOCSF&#8217;s teams in preparation for each districts&#8217; vote on their top three preferred teams. Votes will be accepted until 5:00 PM on Monday, August 7. After the votes are tabulated, the CSO will begin defining scopes and fees for neighborhood projects and assign planning teams to the 13 districts based on the districts&#8217; preferences as well as &#8220;capacity and cost,&#8221; although what relative weight each of these concerns will be given is not stated.</p>
<p><strong>Controversy</strong></p>
<p>Controversy has been a constant virtually from the moment Katrina made landfall. Even before in some cases, since issues of land development in economically depressed neighborhoods have invoked impassioned debate for years). What to do about this city&#8217;s rampant poverty, and whether the proposed solutions help alleviate its ravages or simply remove the poor have become all the more pressing matters in a post-Katrina landscape.</p>
<p>John McIlwain of the <a href="http://www.uli.org">Urban Land Institute</a> (ULI) which was formerly included in the BNOB Commission but whose recommendations were largely rejected, has recently <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-6/115415325196960.xml&#38;coll=1">savaged</a> the state of the city&#8217;s planning efforts in the Times-Picayune. McIlwain and others from ULI leveled numerous criticisms of the city&#8217;s progress in general and the mayor in particular for lack of leadership. ULI&#8217;s recommendations to the BNOB Commission had called for drastically reducing the city&#8217;s footprint in flooded areas, thus-<del>intentionally or not</del>-eliminating dozens of traditionally low-income neighborhoods. Tom Murphy, also of ULI, expressed frustration that the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority has not used eminent domain aggressively enough to seize privately owned blighted properties to resell. In response to the ULI accusations, City Council President Oliver Thomas observed that ULI made &#8220;incorrect assumptions about New Orleans from the outset,&#8221; including proposing the elimination of neighborhoods that were not even below sea level. As far back as <a href="http://humidbeings.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=274&#38;sid=5b21fdc9a9d9c3f2cfc80032763f9fae">November 2005</a>, Council member Cynthia Willard complained that the ULI report did not take into account the people who live in New Orleans East.</p>
<p>The City Council has come under some <a href="http://www.bgr.org/Planning_contract_process_under_fire_TP050906.pdf">criticism</a>  for appointing the Lambert-Danzey without a competitive selection process, as required by the City Charter and the Council&#8217;s own bylaws. (Lambert won a contract with the Council in 2004 to review public housing redevelopment plans, having previously advised the Council on Tax Increment Financing options for the HOPE VI Wal-Mart/St. Thomas redevelopment. The Council and the Lambert Group consider Lambert&#8217;s role in the post-Katrina effort an extension of the 2004 contract.) The <a href="http://www.bgr.org">Bureau of Government Research</a> (BGR), which has been the most public critic of the Council&#8217;s move, has been singled out itself for lack of impartiality: having been founded originally in opposition to Huey Long, the extent to which it exists to expose corruption as opposed to progressive populism has been <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060410/davis/3">questioned</a>.</p>
<p>In a city whose social circles were described as a &#8220;small town&#8221; long before &#8220;small town&#8221; became much truer demographically, business relationships, including political and recovery business, have a heavily personal element. The people behind the titles and acronyms are often vested with far more meaning than their organizations&#8217; mission statements, and the nature of many of those players&#8217; interests and alliances is still being teased out.</p>
