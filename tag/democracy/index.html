			<p>I&#8217;ve been in a bit of a blogging funk lately. It feels like beating a dead horse sometimes, and my flogging arm is getting worn out. If only you could mechanize it some way&#8230; But wait, you can if you have <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1164957505166850.xml&#38;coll=1&#38;thispage=3">2.4 million dollars</a>, and you can beat it from five different cities simultaneously! Yes, I let morbid curiosity overcome me again, and I attended UNOP/AmericaSpeaks&#8217; Community Congress II last Saturday.</p>
<p>I have to give them some credit &#8211; this Congress came much closer to pre-Katrina demographics where race and income were concerned, although not on age or planning district residence. This Congress was rather more participatory than the last one as well. Rather than voting exclusively on pre-ordained options, the <a href="http://www.americaspeaks.org/library/town_meeting.pdf">&#8220;Theme Team&#8221;</a> synthesized alternative scenarios besides the ones presented by UNOP based on the submissions of each table. It&#8217;s a good thing, too, because &#8220;scenario&#8221; is a strong word for what the original options were on each of the six topics. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Roads, Transit and Utilities</strong></p>
<li>Spread available funds evenly throughout the city.</li>
<li>Concentrate available recovery funds in areas of the city with the greatest need*</li>
<li>Raise additional funds, possibly through higher taxes or user fees, so that all infrastructure can be repaired and improved.</li>
<ul>
<li>(note: &#8220;greatest need&#8221; wasn&#8217;t explicitly defined, but from the pros and cons section of the handout, it was clear that UNOP equates greatest need with greatest population, not level of damage)</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More (but not all) of the scenarios and alternatives can be seen in the <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.com/uploads/UNOPpreliminaryreportdraftv4-01856.pdf">Preliminary Report</a>.</p>
<p>Someone remind me again &#8211; how many months of planning has it taken to come up with these &#8220;scenarios&#8221;? I thought at first that this sort of narrowing the scope &#8211; from extremely vague to somewhat vague &#8211; via citizen input might have been a good thing to have done back in July or August. The sort of information produced strikes me as where to <em>start</em> planning, not refine it. But then I got sticker shock:</p>
<blockquote><li>6 topics</li>
<li>approximately 2,500 participants</li>
<li>$2.4 million (for just this session)</li>
</blockquote>
<p>At $400,000 per topic and roughly $960 per participant, what do New Orleanians really gain that&#8217;s of lasting value? Is that really all the public input we can buy for $2.4 million? I hope the funders are watching.</p>

			<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although the Roman empire expanded to a great territory, the Roman republicans were never concerned about the actuality of political participation by citizens living far away from Rome, where the assembly met regularly. In fact, most citizens of the Roman empire probably never attended an assembly, and the situation created a random and skewed system of representation &#8211; those living close to Rome became de facto &#8220;representatives&#8221; of other citizens of the Roman empire.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.oycf.org/Perspectives/3_123199/representative_government.htm">Representative Government and Democracy</a>, Bo Li</p></blockquote>
<p>With all the invocation of Democracy and the Founding Fathers in this latest planning process, one thing that seems to have been forgotten is the role of representation. With all of our actual elected representatives snubbing the UNOP, it&#8217;s more and more doubtful how much backbone the UNOP will have as a &#8220;Unified New Orleans Plan,&#8221; but it&#8217;s far from certain yet whether or how much the Lambert plans or any others will bear much fruit with respect to funding and implementation either. Whatever the fate of the UNOP, it&#8217;s worth drawing some lessons from its latest venture, especially with regard to what passes for public participation, for posterity if nothing else. The first lesson, I think, is well illustrated by the quote about Roman government above: those living close to New Orleans are <em>not</em> adequate &#8220;representatives&#8221; of citizens in the uninhabitable or barely inhabitable portions of our city, however well-intentioned (or not). Public hearings, meetings, and comment periods are indispensable to democratic government, but they&#8217;re never a substitute for proportional representation. (For a thoughtful, multi-faceted review of public partipication, the lack of it, what&#8217;s passed for it, and responses to it in post-Katrina New Orleans &#8211; from the BNOB to UNOP&#8217;s Community Congress &#8211; it&#8217;s definitely worth reading People Get Ready&#8217;s <a href="http://peoplegetready.blogspot.com/2006/10/we-have-more-than-that-at-400-mass-on.html">We have more than that at the 4:00 mass on Saturday</a> post.)</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially times like ours, the representation allowed for by our constitutions and charters &#8211; the mayors, city councils, governors, senators, representatives and presidents &#8211; aren&#8217;t enough; legislation doesn&#8217;t conveniently exist for the level of public involvement required for a whole region&#8217;s reconstruction. The first step is, of course, actively seeking population samples that reflect the real make-up of the city, not just waiting for who happens to show up. In an era when government models itself so much on business, is it too much to ask that we call the marketing department to see how they survey any and all demographics they want to target? It&#8217;s a challenge, to say the least, in the post-Katrina diaspora, but not one that can&#8217;t have its margin of error significantly reduced. There&#8217;s a name for the sort of &#8220;public participation&#8221; we&#8217;ve been treated to so far: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_poll">Voodoo Poll</a>. How apt.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The most common examples of voodoo polls are those which ask for people to phone a number, or to click a voting option on a website, or send back a coupon cut from a newspaper. &#8230; The most glaring difference between a voodoo poll and a legitimate poll is that voodoo polls have self-selecting samples&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But even if we had proportional representation of New Orleans&#8217; citizenry, it&#8217;s still all for naught if the questions don&#8217;t represent the real issues. Plenty of poll-watchers caution that attention to the wording of poll questions is imperative in interpreting their results. You don&#8217;t have to be a bought-out push poller to ask questions that are meaningless, or worse, misleading. This is an area that&#8217;s not new ground either. Here&#8217;s one of the best articulations I&#8217;ve seen of how to approach developing meaningful survey questions, and why it matters:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Good practice in survey research includes framing the questions in a way that people can recognize their own point of view in the alternatives that they are given by the interviewer. Polling is, after all, the art of putting words into peoples&#8217; mouths. Objective practice demands that the words chosen for the questionnaire come close to the words that advocates of each point of view would use if they were given the chance to frame their opinion without prompting. In scientific or academic surveys, the phrasing of questions is usually drawn from published remarks by leaders of one point of view or another or from &#8220;focus groups&#8221; in which ordinary citizens are asked to discuss important issues in their own terms. At SRC [Survey Research Center] we supplement these practices by &#8220;pretesting&#8221; questions in practice interviews. If the respondents to practice interviews have a hard time recognizing their point of view in the questions, then we rewrite them. We try not to have more than one respondent in 20 say they &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; how they feel on an issue unless we feel that the issue itself is so obscure that many people really have no opinion. With a widely discussed issue, a scientific poll should not have more than five percent of answers be &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; (Converse and Presser 1989).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Advocacy polls, on the other hand, frequently &#8220;slant&#8221; questions by raising questions in a way that are favorable to one point of view in a debate-<del>and unfavorable to another</del>-or by posing questions that create a dilemma for proponents of one side (Asher 1990). This practice makes it difficult for persons from one persuasion to answer the questions as stated. They are typically in a quandary because they cannot fully agree with any of the statements offered them, or they cannot choose between the alternatives that are posed because they agree with both or disagree with both. Some poll respondents then refuse to answer the question or say they don&#8217;t know which alternative to choose. Others say &#8220;both?&#8217; or &#8220;neither&#8221; as their reply.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://aad.english.ucsb.edu/docs/hout.report.html">Wording, Polling, and Opinion</a>, Michael Hout</p></blockquote>
<p>Any group that has the capacity to convene Town Hall-style meetings of citizens and collect their input should perhaps be less concerned with determining citizens&#8217; answers to policy questions than with determining the real questions for which various citizens&#8217; groups have already proposed answers. We can stop asking what New Orleanians&#8217; generalized Hopes and Concerns or Needs and Goals are about recovery, and start asking what are the controversies about <em>how</em> to address them, because the options are well-considered and have been articulated by plenty.</p>

			<h3>September 6th, 2006</h3>

			<p>Katrina made New Orleans one enormous laboratory, which didn&#8217;t end with dumping the science projects growing in the fridge. We&#8217;re about to be one of the biggest things to ever happen to Urban Planning (and all the social theory that goes with it), we are, as far as I know, the first city in the U.S. to switch to a primarily charter public school system, the flood gates and levee repairs are the biggest nail-biter to date in the 21st century, and then there&#8217;s the over-arching test of whether and how we&#8217;ll survive at all (which plenty of latter-day Know Nothings are anxiously waiting for us to fail).</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the nonprofits. Last November, Pablo Eisenberg wrote about the <a href="http://www.icnl.org/knowledge/ijnl/vol8iss1/art_4.htm">future of the nonprofit world</a> in <a href="http://www.icnl.org">International Center for Nonprofit Law</a>&#8216;s journal, which <a href="http://northwestcarrollton.com">Karen at NorthwestCarrollton.com</a> brought to my attention. There seems no better place or time to examine the ramifications of his questions &#8220;in the field,&#8221; than here in New Orleans, where every org worth its charter is involved one way or another, and when private money with a public mission is so critical at every level.</p>
<p>Eisenberg&#8217;s first matter of cocern for the future of nonprofits is hardly a new one. It seems there can&#8217;t be too much policing against fraud &#8212; something we do well to remember in these parts, where some people <a href="http://gbitch.blogspot.com/2006/07/all-need-to-fall-down-new-orleans-city.html">can&#8217;t seem to keep their hands off of donated Durangos</a>. He goes on to detail other threats to the integrity of the sector, like conflicts of interest and increasing commercialization, but less obvious and more interesting to me is his call for all nonprofits in general, but foundations in particular, to promote democratic institutions and practices. By this he doesn&#8217;t seem to mean that cancer foundations or Save the Chinchilla drives, say, should quit funding medical research or chinchilla rescue and launch voter registration drives instead, but he claims that:</p>
<blockquote><p>from its earliest days, a primary mission of the nonprofit sector has been the preservation and strengthening of American democracy. This role has taken many forms: protecting civil liberties and individual rights; leveling the playing field for all citizens; building strong democratic institutions; providing a social safety net for the neediest members of society; and assuring a competitive free-enterprise system.</p></blockquote>
<p>An interesting assertion because, while I guess I&#8217;ve always assumed that nonprofithood should entail some self-sacrificial greater good, I&#8217;ve never seen it taken to that level of abstraction and articulated that way. I don&#8217;t know if I would have concluded myself that there&#8217;s a democratic obligation on the part of foundations and charities, but now I have a hard time saying why that shouldn&#8217;t be the case. Between tax-exemption and a stated mission to pursue, a fund or funder yields a certain control to the issue itself, whatever it may be &#8212; even if it&#8217;s Save the Chinchillas, just what constitutes the Good of Chinchillas is not entirely up to you to decide once you get 501<code>(c)(3)</code> status for it.</p>
<p>Eisenberg goes on to point out that the combination of our eroding social safety nets and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor have simultaneously made philanthropy more necessary and more concentrated in fewer hands:</p>
<blockquote><p>The enormous expansion of foundation assets in recent years has added to the inequities in American life. As public support for social programs, job training, affordable housing, and projects to feed the poor and temporarily house the homeless have been reduced, the burden for such responsibilities has increasingly fallen on private individual and institutional philanthropy. Public responsibilities are becoming a matter of private charity. An elite, growing, and unrepresentative group of private foundations are now making decisions about the allocation of funds for social welfare. In a sense, &#8220;noblesse oblige&#8221; is slowly taking over what should be public decision-making.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Far from leveling the playing field, civil society appears to have acquiesced or, at worst, abetted a national policy that has slowly made it more difficult for many citizens to enjoy equal opportunities and, at the same time, made it easier for wealthy citizens to assert greater control over society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noblesse oblige is not what I want to rebuild New Orleans on. As luck would have it, shortly before reading this article, I was talking to my brother, Ben, whose reading list is always worth checking out. It turns out Ben is in the middle of Robert Caro&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker">The Power Broker</a>, about Robert Moses an &#8220;idealistic advocate for Progressive reform&#8221; who went on to become more powerful than mayors and governors of New York, largely via sitting (unelected) on boards and committees. I haven&#8217;t received the copy I ordered yet, but from what I understand, Moses&#8217; noblesse oblige was not much appreciated by the end (even around here: as an advocate for cars and freeways over public transportation, he happens to be the guy who proposed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieux_Carre_Expressway">Vieux Carre Riverfront Expressway</a>, giving us the Second Battle of New Orleans).</p>
<p>One of the most interesting responses to Eisenberg is <a href="http://www.icnl.org/knowledge/ijnl/vol8iss1/art_4r2.htm">H. Peter Karoff&#8217;s</a>. He ethusiastically takes up the call for greater transparency and public accountibility in nonprofit workings, lambasting paternalistic attitudes among some foundation trustees:</p>
<blockquote><p>Major foundations more often than not have viewed themselves as the source of innovation, &#8220;the manufacturer,&#8221; with little if any input from recipient organizations and communities, &#8220;the users.&#8221; Strategic and Venture Philanthropists likewise often view themselves as crucial to innovation. It is assumed that the nonprofit organization recipients and programs will not, cannot, perform without them. Nonprofit organizations, which are often intermediaries between funders and communities being served, are sometimes guilty of the same patronizing assumptions about constituencies and clients.</p></blockquote>
<p>Karoff points to the Internet and Open Source software development as the torchbearers of the new Democracy, and the exemplars for future nonprofit management. It&#8217;s an admirable and popular sentiment, praising the organization of the Internet and proposing it as a model, but I&#8217;m not sure it always means very much without a closer examination of what sorts of collaboration take off and why, and whether the problem being proposed for solution Internet-style lends itself to such a strategy and how. What does it get the chinchillas? And what does it mean for the GNOF, the NOCSF, the LRA Fund, etc.?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know, but I think a large part of the answer comes from the <a href="http://northwestcarrollton.com/2006/09/01/zealous-nuts/">zealous nut</a> phenomenon (thanks to Karen again). To add a little to what Karen has already excerpted on her site from the <a href="http://www.pps.org/info/bulletin/zealous_nuts">Project for Public Spaces article</a> on the passionate amateurs who are deeply engaged in the upkeep and development of their own communities:</p>
<blockquote><p>More and more developers, designers and leaders are now realizing that the success of a public project depends on the participation of the public itself. That seems obvious, but it took a long time for many decision makers to figure that out.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to note that foundations in some places (like the <a href="http://www.ruthmottfoundation.org">Ruth Mott Foundation</a> in Flint, Michigan) are starting to shift their focus toward the crazy neighborhood ladies (and gentlemen) when it comes to civic improvement.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, it should be interesting to watch the numerous funds and organizations at work here, local, national and international, and their degrees of responsiveness to the public they aim to serve. This debate takes on so much more urgency when actual public policy is being determined by foundations (no offence to the chinchillas). I see some interest in &#8220;public input&#8221; on the part of the UNOP and its funders, but it&#8217;s not quite the same as the kind of democratic responsiveness and public involvement I see in the Eisenberg PPS articles, not yet anyway. How the planning teams themselves relate to their assigned districts will be the test, I suppose.</p>
