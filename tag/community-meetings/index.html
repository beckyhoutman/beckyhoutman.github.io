		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>I&#8217;m not sure why I keep attending <a href="www.unifiedneworleansplan.com">UNOP</a> events. I guess I just feel compelled to see what they&#8217;re going to pull next &#8211; it&#8217;s certainly not from a sense that I&#8217;m &#8220;participating;&#8221; there&#8217;s only so much use that can come of asking people to rank their nebulous Needs and Goals (or Hopes and Concerns as was the case yesterday), and only so many times it&#8217;s worth asking. For the record, UNOP, I think crime is bad, flood protection is good, and some affordable housing, schools and hospitals would be rather nice too, if I&#8217;m allowed to have that many preferences. So I attended yesterday morning&#8217;s Community Congress #1 at the Convention Center&#8217;s <em>La Nouvelle Orleans Ballroom</em>, where I was treated to presentations on some of the citywide data that&#8217;s been collected and analysed to date, and to the first instance of <a href="www.americaspeaks.org">AmericaSpeaks&#8217;</a> involvement in feedback collection.</p>
<p>Hearing some infrastructure, housing, health care, etc statistics was of some interest &#8211; not least because it&#8217;s the first substantive product made public from the citywide component of the plan. As someone mentioned at the last <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/section/22-70/">CSO</a> meeting, it would have been nice if they&#8217;d posted all or some of it for citizens to view and digest before being asked to provide feedback on it, but they promise it <em>will</em> go on The Website (for posterity, apparently). Wait and see&#8230;</p>
<p>The debut of AmericaSpeaks, the organization &#8220;brought in to support the New Orleans planning effort because of concerns that many displaced New Orleanians, especially low-income African-Americans, have no voice in recovery decisions&#8221; and to collect data and citizen feedback, was of some interest as well. I hope they have some fancier tricks up their 21st century sleeves for putting the <a href="http://www.nola.com/printer/printer.ssf?/base/news-6/1160641779246500.xml">$3 million</a> they expect their endeavor to cost ($2.3 million already committed by mysterious private foundations they decline to identify) to use in future meetings &#8211; one of the first things they demonstrated to the ballroom using their wireless, real-time polling gizmos was that we were decidedly not consistent with the pre-Katrina demographics in race, income, geography or age (curiously, they made a specialpoint of emphasizing that the 15-19 year old age group was dramatically underrepresented, and we should take care to consider their interests &#8211; under-14 year olds apparently need not worry). What they intend to do to address the imbalance isn&#8217;t quite clear to me. They did note that the Congress would be broadcast on cable access channels in the &#8220;diaspora cities&#8221; and that viewers there would be able to provide their feedback via the UNOP&#8217;s toll-free number, but the staffer who answered when I called hadn&#8217;t heard anything about that yet.</p>
<p>Maybe the real outreach component of AmericaSpeaks&#8217; program hasn&#8217;t begun in earnest &#8211; most of the press surrounding AmericaSpeaks&#8217; involvement revolves around the ultimate December 2 Community Congress, so it&#8217;s not impossible. I think it would be of enormous benefit to New Orleans to work with an organization that&#8217;s capable of locating enough respondents, both here in town and elsewhere, to make up something approaching a representative statistical sampling of pre-Katrina residents and to gather their feelings on how our recovery should go. Unfortunately, not only is it unclear how displaced residents will be reached, the UNOP is losing the audience it&#8217;s already had. Among the ways in which an AmericaSpeaks <a href="http://www.americaspeaks.org/services/town_meetings/what_is.htm">21st Century Town Meeting</a> (registered trademark) is supposed to be superior to the old-fashioned public hearing is that the public hearing &#8220;primarily engages the &#8216;usual suspects&#8217; &#8211; citizens already civically active on specific issues,&#8221; and yet there we were, the usual self-selected suspects, diligently reporting to be put through our paces. And that group is rapidly de-selecting &#8211; I see fewer and fewer of the faces I know to still be active in their own neighborhoods and in general recovery-related activities. I guess even morbid curiosity wears out after a while.</p>
<p>How to accurately sample a population of which more than half is displaced may be one of the many stretches of uncharted territory New Orleans is faced with right now, but how to compose survey questions to elicit worthwhile, unambiguous answers isn&#8217;t. Polling is a pretty well-developed industry. The Usual Suspects may provide an incomplete data set, but they&#8217;re by and large an earnest bunch, who give recovery matters a lot of thought, and their responses as individuals count as much as anyone else&#8217;s. So what was made of their sacrifice of three hours of a beautiful Saturday morning? Not much, as far as I could tell. I&#8217;m not sure how the questions were crafted &#8211; I&#8217;m sure UNOP told the AmericaSpeaks people what they wanted to ask, but my impression of how AmericaSpeaks conducted the polling suggested that they were more involved than mere readers and tabulators, and anyway, I&#8217;d expect an organization that purports to specialize in citizen-led contribution to decision-making to have some expertise how best to craft that opportunity to contribute. A lot of the questions were of the no-brainer variety: it won&#8217;t come as much surprise that I&#8217;m not the only New Orleanian who thinks hospitals are important. And when issues aren&#8217;t so trivial, it isn&#8217;t so trivial to design a statement so it can be rated on a 1 to 5 scale &#8211; but it isn&#8217;t rocket science either. Anyone who&#8217;s ever had to answer &#8220;on a scale of 1 to 5&#8230;&#8221; (which is just about everyone) has run across the dilemma conditional situations. It may not be possible to eliminate that entirely, but you can go a long way with a little common sense. I wish I&#8217;d saved the 5 page paper questionnaire we were asked to complete, or better yet, just not turned mine in for all the good it&#8217;ll do, so I could quote some of the howlers verbatim &#8211; one example off the top of my head:</p>
<blockquote><p>On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 equalling &#8220;reason to return to New Orleans&#8221; and 5 equalling &#8220;reason not to return,&#8221; rate the following: adequate levee protection.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does that mean I&#8217;ve returned because I think the levee protection is adequate, or does that mean I <em>would</em> return <em>if</em> it were? After presentations that included current and projected levee status, which is allegedly back up to its pre-Katrina level and undergoing further improvements, I really don&#8217;t know which to assume. It didn&#8217;t get any better on the rest of the pages.</p>
<p>Also eyebrow raising were a couple instances when AmericaSpeaks president Carolyn Lukensmeyer prefaced questions with admonitions of what to consider while voting. In one case involving funding for parks and recreation areas, she told us to remember the presentation we just heard, and how important it was For The Children (who were probably out enjoying parks and recreation areas rather than sitting in a dark ballroom pretending to be a market-research focus group). If you&#8217;d like to capture the true Voice of the People, AmericaSpeaks, you&#8217;ll do well to let us remember what to consider on our own. In another case, regarding whether it&#8217;s important or not for New Orleans to be the most populous city in the state, Ms. Lukensmeyer brought up Galveston and Houston, raising the specter of becoming a tiny, boutique tourist town while all the real industry moves upriver. Although that happens to be a concern of mine, I don&#8217;t think it was AmericaSpeaks&#8217; position to frame the issue in a way that steered attention to an all-or-nothing sort of view while there&#8217;s still legitimate room for debate about a smaller, but still vital city. It really isn&#8217;t their position to remind us of <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m left with the bitter feeling that this is just another UNOP photo-op &#8211; the citizenry raptly attentive to the big screen with their very own thoughts and feelings reflected back to them: how <em>democratic</em> (at one point the Founding Fathers were even invoked). And this time they&#8217;ve literally <a href="http://thinknola.com/blog/think/2006/08/04/outsourcing-democracy/">outsourced</a> it.</p>
<p>The Ballroom has spoken.</p>

			<h3>October 14th, 2006</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>I just got back from the <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/districts/2/">District 2</a> Needs &#38; Goals <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/districts/2/meetings/58/">kick-off</a> meeting with H3 Studio. A few quick thoughts:</p>
<p>Their slide presentation suggested that they&#8217;ve already compiled a lot of information about the district, its neighborhood groups (besides the &#8220;official&#8221; eight city-defined neighborhoods they&#8217;ve identified 28 actual functioning groups), and plans for particular areas that are already in existence, both pre- and post-Katrina. H3 principal John Hoal indicated several times that this information would be on &#8220;the website,&#8221; which, when I asked about it later, proved to be the <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com">UNOP</a> site. No luck with that yet, unless it&#8217;s squirreled away somewhere pretty clever. The too predictable <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/districts/2/deliverables/">Deliverables &#38; Support Documents</a> page is still &#8220;coming soon&#8221; as of this post. Too bad, because it really does look like they&#8217;ve been doing they&#8217;re homework, including walking every foot of sidewalk and driving every street in the district. The maps they produced for their slideshow, of the varying conditions of streets, sidewalks, housing, etc would be great resources. <a href="http://www.h3studio.com/">H3&#8242;s own website</a> was, sadly, one of those Flash affairs (I had to download an upgrade just to see it at all) that amounts to nothing more than a set of incredibly fancy lists. There are some teasers of maps and renderings that show up when you hover over the lists, but no links to close-ups, at least not in Firefox. It&#8217;s also completely unsearchable.  It&#8217;s frustrating to see such an incredible potential information source so overdesigned and &#8211; I was going to say underutilized &#8211; but it&#8217;s really flat-out unutilized.</p>
<p>It was good to see key members of the <a href="http://unifiedneworleansplan.com/home2/districts/2/deliverables/">planning team</a> in attendence and leading the proceedings, including John Hoal, Derek Hoeferlin and Laura Lyon. Besides the slide presentation on the course of the UNOP meetings to come and on the research H3 et al have done to date, the rest of the session was devoted to small groups reviewing the Needs, Vision and Goals already collected by H3, and then selecting their top three concerns from those listed or their own devising. There was a lot of consensus when the small groups reported back &#8211; I guess we&#8217;re not a very contentious lot around here, fortunately. Crime, schools, decent affordable housing in historically appropriate styles (rehabilitated historic homes wherever possible), community health care, and closing the above/below St. Charles divide were big hits, but the applause-winning show-stopper was actual enforcement of existing zoning. All valid and interesting enough, but a bit on the woolly side &#8211; who&#8217;s pro-crime or anti-education? The devil is in the details, after all (hence, I think, the support for enforcing zoning), and we&#8217;re still a long way from knowing how and when those will be developed and implemented.</p>

			<h3>July 24th, 2006</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>It&#8217;s come to my <a href="http://bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=7673">attention</a> that last Friday, the New Orleans Community Support Foundation selected its contenders for the technical help teams that neighborhood and planning district groups will be able to choose from. Since the NOCSF was set up to administer use of a $3.5 million Rockefeller Foundation planning grant and direct the use of the recovery funds Congress has approved, this is hardly a small matter. This meeting also established the schedule and procedure for community members to get involved &#8211; a meeting on Sunday, July 30, 2:00-6:00PM was announced (location To Be Determined) at which residents can meet the prospective planners, settle on criteria for working with them, and determine their neighborhoods&#8217; and/or districts&#8217; official boundaries. A second meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, August 1, at which attendees can pick their top three choices for their groups&#8217; assintance teams. Again, not trivial things. But where was this announcement made? As far as I&#8217;ve been able to determine, the only local media to publish the date and details was <a href="http://bayoubuzz.com/">BayouBuzz</a>. The Times-Picayune did cover <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/metro/index.ssf?/base/news-16/115354836683610.xml&#38;coll=1">last Friday&#8217;s panel meeting</a>, but nothing further about meeting times or agendas, despite generalizations about the &#8220;strong voice&#8221; neighborhoods will have in their own planning processes. As for other local media, I&#8217;ve poked around a bit, but haven&#8217;t turned anything up as of yet. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much extra room in the &#8220;Local News&#8221; segments these days when Dr. Anna Pou is on the loose. To their credit, the NOCSF did post the meeting info on their <a href="www.unifiedneworleansplan.org/meetings.html">website</a>, and they say they&#8217;ve disseminated the information to untold numbers of community groups &#8211; I hope they have. I hope they really are serious about including our numerous community groups in their own rebuilding efforts. I&#8217;m pleased to see how many local firms made the list &#8211; that&#8217;s a step in the right direction. But I&#8217;m still a bit concerend &#8211; where are the other local media on this? Where is the NOCSF when it comes to leaning on the local media if they won&#8217;t pick it up on their own? How much faith can we put in a planning commission whose primary outreach tool is a <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.org/happening.html">content-shy</a> website that already needs some of its links retooled (try navigating off the <a href="http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.org/contactus.php">&#8220;Contact Us&#8221;</a> page, for example)? How far can we rely on an organization that doesn&#8217;t even have a location settled for a meeting less than a week away? That gives the community less than a week&#8217;s notice for that meeting? Cross your fingers, and register to attend&#8230;</p>
